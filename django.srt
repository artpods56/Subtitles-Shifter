00:01:03,358 --> 00:01:06,194
[theme song plays]

3
00:03:53,695 --> 00:03:56,114
[chains rattling]

4
00:04:11,212 --> 00:04:12,964
[man grunting]

5
00:04:03,261 --> 00:04:05,138
[horse nickering]

6
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:21,863
- Whoa.
- [horses snorting]

7
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:24,699
[gentle metallic rattling]

8
00:04:28,161 --> 00:04:29,329
Whoa.

9
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,971
Who's that stumblin'
around in the dark?

10
00:04:47,138 --> 00:04:50,934
State your business
or prepare to get winged!

11
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:56,189
Calm yourselves, gentlemen...
I mean you no harm.

12
00:04:56,356 --> 00:05:01,194
I'm simply a fellow weary traveler.
Whoa, boy.

13
00:05:02,528 --> 00:05:04,197
Good cold evening, gentlemen.

14
00:05:04,364 --> 00:05:06,699
I'm looking for a pair of slave traders

15
00:05:06,866 --> 00:05:08,534
that go by the name
of the Speck Brothers.

16
00:05:08,701 --> 00:05:10,536
Might that be you?

17
00:05:11,913 --> 00:05:14,666
- Who wants to know?
- Well, I do.

18
00:05:14,832 --> 00:05:16,709
I'm Dr. King Schultz.
This is my horse, Fritz.

19
00:05:16,876 --> 00:05:17,794
[snorting]

20
00:05:17,961 --> 00:05:21,464
- What kinda doctor?
- [Schultz] Dentist.

21
00:05:21,631 --> 00:05:23,424
Now, are you the Speck Brothers?

22
00:05:23,591 --> 00:05:26,386
And did you purchase those men
at the Greenville slave auction?

23
00:05:26,552 --> 00:05:29,138
- So what?
- So I wish to parley with you.

24
00:05:29,305 --> 00:05:32,642
- Speak English.
- [chuckles] Oh, I'm sorry.

25
00:05:32,809 --> 00:05:35,019
Please forgive me.
It is a second language.

26
00:05:35,186 --> 00:05:38,481
Now, amongst your inventory,
I've been led to believe,

27
00:05:38,648 --> 00:05:41,067
is a specimen I'm keen to acquire.

28
00:05:41,234 --> 00:05:42,694
Hello, you poor devils!

29
00:05:44,028 --> 00:05:46,614
Is there one amongst you
who was formerly a resident

30
00:05:46,781 --> 00:05:50,076
of the Carrucan plantation?

31
00:05:50,827 --> 00:05:53,037
[man] I'm from the Carrucan plantation.

32
00:05:54,664 --> 00:05:56,040
Who said that?

33
00:06:03,589 --> 00:06:04,841
[Schultz lighting match]

34
00:06:43,254 --> 00:06:44,630
What's your name?

35
00:06:48,801 --> 00:06:50,678
Django.

36
00:06:50,845 --> 00:06:53,598
Then you are exactly
the one I'm looking for.

37
00:06:55,475 --> 00:06:57,685
Do you know who
the Brittle Brothers are?

38
00:07:01,314 --> 00:07:02,315
Who are they?

39
00:07:04,734 --> 00:07:06,360
Big John.

40
00:07:07,153 --> 00:07:08,488
Ellis.

41
00:07:09,906 --> 00:07:13,826
Roger.
Sometime they call him Lil Raj.

42
00:07:15,203 --> 00:07:17,413
They was overseers
at the Carrucan plantation.

43
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,664
Not anymore.

44
00:07:21,751 --> 00:07:22,794
Tell me...

45
00:07:23,377 --> 00:07:26,172
...if you were to see
any of these three gentlemen again,

46
00:07:26,339 --> 00:07:29,008
- would you recognize them?
- [man] Hey.

47
00:07:29,175 --> 00:07:31,636
- Stop talkin' to him like that.
- Like What?

48
00:07:31,803 --> 00:07:33,346
Like that.

49
00:07:33,513 --> 00:07:35,807
My good man,
I'm simply trying to ascertain...

50
00:07:35,973 --> 00:07:38,017
Speak English, goddamn it.

51
00:07:38,184 --> 00:07:39,936
Everybody calm down.

52
00:07:40,103 --> 00:07:43,815
I'm simply a customer
trying to conduct a transaction.

53
00:07:43,981 --> 00:07:46,984
I don't care. No sale.
Now, off with ya.

54
00:07:47,151 --> 00:07:50,154
[scoffs] Don't be ridiculous.
Of course they're for sale.

55
00:07:50,988 --> 00:07:52,448
Move it.

56
00:07:52,615 --> 00:07:57,537
My good man, did you simply get carried
away with your dramatic gesture

57
00:07:57,703 --> 00:08:01,499
or are you pointing your weapon at me
with lethal intention?

58
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:04,460
Last chance, fancy pants.

59
00:08:05,878 --> 00:08:08,214
Oh, very well.

60
00:08:08,881 --> 00:08:09,924
[horse whinnying]

61
00:08:11,509 --> 00:08:13,845
[man screaming]

62
00:08:17,974 --> 00:08:19,642
[scream echoing]

63
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:35,241
[screaming continues]

64
00:08:36,993 --> 00:08:39,412
I'm sorry to put a bullet in your beast,

65
00:08:39,579 --> 00:08:41,497
but I didn't want you
to do anything rash

66
00:08:41,664 --> 00:08:43,958
before you had a moment
to come to your senses.

67
00:08:44,125 --> 00:08:47,545
You goddamn son of a bitch!

68
00:08:47,712 --> 00:08:50,506
- You shot Roscoe!
- Well...

69
00:08:50,673 --> 00:08:52,383
And you killed Ace!

70
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:55,219
I only shot your brother once
he threatened to shoot me.

71
00:08:55,386 --> 00:08:58,222
And I do believe I have...
one, two, three, four...

72
00:08:58,389 --> 00:09:01,350
...five witnesses
who can attest to that fact.

73
00:09:01,517 --> 00:09:04,395
- Damn leg's busted!
- No doubt.

74
00:09:04,562 --> 00:09:07,106
Now, if you could keep your
caterwauling down to a minimum,

75
00:09:07,273 --> 00:09:10,610
I'd like to finish my line
of inquiry with young Django.

76
00:09:10,776 --> 00:09:12,778
[screaming resumes]

77
00:09:14,614 --> 00:09:18,075
- [man] God-fuckin'-damn it!
- As I was saying...

78
00:09:18,242 --> 00:09:21,954
...if you were to see the Brittle
Brothers again, you could recognize 'em?

79
00:09:22,622 --> 00:09:24,332
Yeah.

80
00:09:24,498 --> 00:09:25,791
Sold American!

81
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:29,921
So, Mr. Speck? Mr. Speck?
How much for young Django here?

82
00:09:35,218 --> 00:09:37,845
That iron is nasty business.

83
00:09:43,059 --> 00:09:45,186
Oh, could you hold this for a moment?

84
00:09:47,313 --> 00:09:48,814
Thank you. Django?

85
00:09:48,981 --> 00:09:50,858
Get up on that horse.

86
00:09:51,025 --> 00:09:52,818
Also, if I were you,

87
00:09:52,985 --> 00:09:56,989
I'd take that winter coat
the dear departed Speck left behind.

88
00:10:11,128 --> 00:10:15,007
Nigger!
Don't you touch my brother's coat.

89
00:10:23,975 --> 00:10:25,518
[screaming]

90
00:10:25,685 --> 00:10:30,606
Goddamn it! Oh!
[moaning]

91
00:10:32,275 --> 00:10:37,446
One hundred... ten... 20...

92
00:10:37,613 --> 00:10:39,448
...and five...

93
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,867
...for young Django here.

94
00:10:42,034 --> 00:10:44,203
And since he won't
be needing it anymore,

95
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:46,872
I'd like to purchase your brother's nag.

96
00:10:47,581 --> 00:10:52,545
Also, Mr. Speck, I'm afraid
I will require a bill of sale.

97
00:10:52,712 --> 00:10:54,297
Do you have one?

98
00:10:54,463 --> 00:10:57,383
- You go to hell, dentist.
- [scoffs]

99
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,552
I thought not.

100
00:10:59,719 --> 00:11:03,222
No worries. I come prepared.

101
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,145
Thank you.

102
00:11:09,312 --> 00:11:12,898
This will serve nicely
as a bill of sale.

103
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,405
[nickering]

104
00:11:25,244 --> 00:11:26,245
Whoa.

105
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:33,878
Now, as to you poor devils.

106
00:11:34,045 --> 00:11:39,091
So, as I see it, when it comes to
the subject of what to do next,

107
00:11:39,258 --> 00:11:42,094
you gentlemen have two choices.

108
00:11:42,261 --> 00:11:47,391
One: Once I'm gone, you could lift
that beast off the remaining Speck,

109
00:11:47,558 --> 00:11:49,477
then carry him to the nearest town.

110
00:11:49,643 --> 00:11:53,230
Which would be at least
37 miles back the way you came.

111
00:11:53,397 --> 00:11:59,070
Or two: You could unshackle yourselves,
take that rifle,

112
00:11:59,236 --> 00:12:01,781
put a bullet in his head,
bury the two of them deep,

113
00:12:01,947 --> 00:12:05,493
and then make your way to a
more enlightened area of this country.

114
00:12:06,577 --> 00:12:07,745
Choice is yours.

115
00:12:07,912 --> 00:12:12,291
Oh, and on the off chance there are
any astronomy aficionados amongst you,

116
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:15,461
the North Star is that one.

117
00:12:16,921 --> 00:12:20,091
Ta-ta. [clucking]

118
00:12:34,897 --> 00:12:38,984
Now wait a minute, fellas.
Let's talk about this!

119
00:12:39,235 --> 00:12:42,446
- [lantern crashing]
- [chains rattling]

120
00:12:42,613 --> 00:12:46,033
You gotta be reasonable
in a situation like this!

121
00:12:47,493 --> 00:12:50,496
I'm not a bad guy.
I'm just doin' my job!

122
00:12:50,663 --> 00:12:54,250
Blueberry, didn't I
give you my last apple?

123
00:12:54,417 --> 00:12:57,378
Tell you what, boys:
Take me to the doc in El Paso,

124
00:12:57,545 --> 00:12:59,588
- I'll get you your freedom.
- [gun cocking]

125
00:12:59,755 --> 00:13:03,509
- No. No, please...
- [gunshot echoing]

126
00:13:19,233 --> 00:13:21,068
[dogs barking nearby]

127
00:13:45,885 --> 00:13:48,179
[squeaking]

128
00:13:48,846 --> 00:13:50,222
All right, now.

129
00:13:50,389 --> 00:13:52,391
I'd like you to
take two of these tonight...

130
00:13:52,558 --> 00:13:54,768
- [coughing]
- ...and then in the morning...

131
00:13:56,896 --> 00:13:58,689
That's a nigger on a horse.

132
00:14:24,298 --> 00:14:26,091
What's everybody staring at?

133
00:14:26,258 --> 00:14:28,761
They ain't never seen
no nigger on a horse before.

134
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:32,223
[goats bleating]

135
00:14:41,065 --> 00:14:42,066
Whoa.

136
00:14:52,117 --> 00:14:54,119
Good morning, innkeeper!

137
00:14:55,454 --> 00:14:57,915
Two beers for two weary travelers.

138
00:14:58,082 --> 00:14:59,833
It's still a bit early.

139
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,419
We won't be open for another hour.

140
00:15:02,586 --> 00:15:04,421
By then, we'll be servin' breakfast.

141
00:15:04,588 --> 00:15:10,010
[gasping] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... what
the hell you think you're doing, boy?

142
00:15:10,177 --> 00:15:12,263
Get that nigger outta here!

143
00:15:15,808 --> 00:15:19,812
- [panting] Help! Help!
- Innkeeper!

144
00:15:19,979 --> 00:15:23,148
Remember, get the sheriff,
not the marshal.

145
00:15:23,315 --> 00:15:25,192
[man] Sheriff! Help!

146
00:15:25,359 --> 00:15:26,986
Alas.

147
00:15:28,362 --> 00:15:30,906
Now we must act as our own bartender.

148
00:15:33,325 --> 00:15:35,077
Sit down, my boy.

149
00:15:44,753 --> 00:15:47,631
- What kind of dentist are you?
- [chortles]

150
00:15:48,465 --> 00:15:53,053
Despite that cart, I haven't
practiced dentistry in five years.

151
00:15:57,683 --> 00:16:00,978
But these days,
I practice a new profession...

152
00:16:03,188 --> 00:16:04,565
...bounty hunter.

153
00:16:11,155 --> 00:16:12,990
Do you know what a bounty hunter is?

154
00:16:13,699 --> 00:16:14,742
No.

155
00:16:14,908 --> 00:16:16,118
Well...

156
00:16:17,745 --> 00:16:21,874
...the way the slave trade
deals in human lives for cash,

157
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:24,376
a bounty hunter deals in corpses.

158
00:16:24,543 --> 00:16:26,754
[tsking] Hat

159
00:16:30,507 --> 00:16:32,051
Prost.

160
00:16:40,225 --> 00:16:42,895
The state places a bounty
on a man's head.

161
00:16:43,062 --> 00:16:45,731
I track that man, I find that man,
I kill that man.

162
00:16:45,898 --> 00:16:49,860
After I've killed him, I transport that
man's corpse back to the authorities.

163
00:16:50,027 --> 00:16:52,738
Sometimes that's easier said than done.

164
00:16:52,905 --> 00:16:55,699
I show that corpse to the authorities,
proving yes, indeed,

165
00:16:55,866 --> 00:16:57,576
I truly have killed him,

166
00:16:57,743 --> 00:17:00,746
at which point the authorities
pay me the bounty.

167
00:17:00,913 --> 00:17:04,249
So, like slavery,
it's a flesh for cash business.

168
00:17:05,876 --> 00:17:06,877
What's a bounty?

169
00:17:10,673 --> 00:17:12,132
It's like a reward.

170
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:15,678
You kill people?
And they give you a reward?

171
00:17:15,844 --> 00:17:17,721
Certain people, yeah.

172
00:17:17,888 --> 00:17:19,014
Bad people?

173
00:17:19,181 --> 00:17:23,143
Ah! Badder they are,
bigger the reward.

174
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:25,604
Which brings me to you.

175
00:17:25,771 --> 00:17:30,025
And I must admit, I'm at a bit of
a quandary when it comes to you.

176
00:17:30,192 --> 00:17:32,611
On one hand, I despise slavery.

177
00:17:32,778 --> 00:17:35,906
On the other hand, I need your help.

178
00:17:36,073 --> 00:17:39,451
If you're not in a position to refuse,
all the better.

179
00:17:40,327 --> 00:17:42,996
So, for the time being, I'm gonna
make this slavery malarkey

180
00:17:43,163 --> 00:17:45,374
work to my benefit.

181
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:50,212
Still, having said that, I feel guilty.

182
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:57,136
So, I would like the two of us
to enter into an agreement.

183
00:18:04,184 --> 00:18:06,019
I'm looking for the Brittle Brothers.

184
00:18:10,691 --> 00:18:12,025
However, at this endeavor,

185
00:18:12,192 --> 00:18:17,322
I'm at a slight disadvantage insofar
as I don't know what they look like.

186
00:18:18,574 --> 00:18:21,452
But you do. Don't ya?

187
00:18:21,618 --> 00:18:23,829
I know what they look like all right.

188
00:18:23,996 --> 00:18:27,499
Good. So here's my agreement.

189
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:31,086
- You travel with me until we find them.
- Where we goin'?

190
00:18:31,253 --> 00:18:33,881
I hear at least two of them
are overseeing up in Gatlinburg,

191
00:18:34,047 --> 00:18:36,216
but I don't know where.

192
00:18:36,383 --> 00:18:40,679
That means we visit every plantation
in Gatlinburg till we find 'em.

193
00:18:40,846 --> 00:18:46,101
And when we find them,
you point them out, and I kill them.

194
00:18:47,144 --> 00:18:50,522
You do that, I agree
to give you your freedom,

195
00:18:50,689 --> 00:18:54,818
$25 per Brittle Brother. That's $75.

196
00:18:54,985 --> 00:18:58,697
And, as if on cue,
here comes the sheriff.

197
00:19:02,534 --> 00:19:03,786
[scoffs]

198
00:19:06,455 --> 00:19:11,960
OK, boys. Fun's over. Come on out.

199
00:19:14,588 --> 00:19:19,176
- [overlapping chatter]
- All right, folks, calm down.

200
00:19:20,219 --> 00:19:21,929
Go about your business.

201
00:19:22,721 --> 00:19:25,098
These jokers will be gone soon.

202
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:32,481
Now, why y'all wanna come
into my town and start trouble?

203
00:19:32,648 --> 00:19:35,901
And scare all these nice people.

204
00:19:37,069 --> 00:19:39,738
You ain't got nothing better to do

205
00:19:39,905 --> 00:19:43,116
than to come into Bill Sharp's town

206
00:19:43,283 --> 00:19:45,536
and show your ass?

207
00:19:45,702 --> 00:19:47,454
- [metal springing noise]
- [sheriff screaming]

208
00:19:47,621 --> 00:19:50,582
- [crowd gasping]
- [groaning]

209
00:19:50,749 --> 00:19:52,125
[woman screams]

210
00:19:53,877 --> 00:19:57,798
- What'd you just do to our sheriff?
- [groaning]

211
00:19:59,258 --> 00:20:01,134
- [yelling]
- [shot echoing]

212
00:20:01,301 --> 00:20:02,511
[woman gasps]

213
00:20:02,678 --> 00:20:04,638
[crowd screaming]

214
00:20:09,101 --> 00:20:11,436
Now you can get the marshal.

215
00:20:12,938 --> 00:20:15,274
[man] Marshal! Marshal!

216
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,693
- Should we wait inside?
- Can we just leave?

217
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,069
After you.

218
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:25,742
Move that buckboard a long ways
across the street from the saloon.

219
00:20:25,909 --> 00:20:28,787
I want six men, six rifles behind it.

220
00:20:28,954 --> 00:20:31,123
I want two men,
two rifles up on this roof.

221
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:33,625
Two men, two rifles on that roof.

222
00:20:33,792 --> 00:20:36,753
All the barrels aimed
at that front door.

223
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,923
Somebody get poor Bill
outta the goddamn street.

224
00:20:41,091 --> 00:20:43,260
You in the saloon!

225
00:20:43,427 --> 00:20:46,763
We got a hundred rifles aimed
at every way out of that buildin'.

226
00:20:47,472 --> 00:20:50,642
You got one chance
to get out of this alive.

227
00:20:51,476 --> 00:20:53,979
You and your nigger come out right now
with your hands over your head,

228
00:20:54,146 --> 00:20:56,106
and I mean right now.

229
00:20:57,232 --> 00:21:00,652
[Schultz] Is this the marshal
I have the pleasure of addressing?

230
00:21:00,819 --> 00:21:02,613
Yes, it is.

231
00:21:02,779 --> 00:21:04,865
This is U.S. Marshal Gill Tatum.

232
00:21:05,032 --> 00:21:07,326
[Schultz]
Na wunderbar, marshal.

233
00:21:07,826 --> 00:21:11,413
I have relieved myself of all weapons,

234
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:14,499
and just as you have instructed,

235
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:17,336
I am ready to step outside

236
00:21:17,502 --> 00:21:21,590
with my hands raised above my head.

237
00:21:22,674 --> 00:21:25,093
I trust as a representative

238
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:28,639
of the criminal justice system of
the United States of America,

239
00:21:28,805 --> 00:21:34,645
I shan't be shot down in the street
by either you or your deputies

240
00:21:34,811 --> 00:21:37,648
before I've had my day in court.

241
00:21:37,814 --> 00:21:40,150
You mean like you did our sheriff.

242
00:21:40,317 --> 00:21:42,110
Shot him down like a dog in the street.

243
00:21:42,277 --> 00:21:44,613
Yes, that's exactly what I mean.

244
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:50,452
Do I have your word as a lawman not to
shoot me down like a dog in the street?

245
00:21:53,789 --> 00:21:57,042
Well, much as we'd all enjoy
seeing something like that,

246
00:21:57,209 --> 00:22:00,212
ain't nobody gonna cheat
the hangman in my town.

247
00:22:01,254 --> 00:22:04,216
Fair enough, marshal.
Here we come.

248
00:22:06,051 --> 00:22:08,220
They're a little tense out there.

249
00:22:08,387 --> 00:22:11,848
So don't make any quick movements,
and let me do the talking.

250
00:22:12,182 --> 00:22:14,851
- [doors squeaking open]
- Come ahead.

251
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,151
You unarmed?

252
00:22:23,318 --> 00:22:25,028
[Schultz] Yes, indeed we are.

253
00:22:25,779 --> 00:22:29,116
Marshal Tatum, may I address you
and your deputies,

254
00:22:29,282 --> 00:22:31,243
and apparently the
entire town of Daughtrey,

255
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:33,745
as to the incident that just occurred?

256
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,541
- Go on.
- Thank you.

257
00:22:37,708 --> 00:22:39,835
My name is Dr. King Schultz.

258
00:22:40,002 --> 00:22:43,255
Like yourself, marshal,
I'm a servant of the court.

259
00:22:43,422 --> 00:22:46,842
The man lying dead in the dirt,
who the good people of Daughtrey

260
00:22:47,009 --> 00:22:51,096
saw fit to elect as their sheriff,
who went by the name of Bill Sharp,

261
00:22:51,263 --> 00:22:55,851
is actually a wanted outlaw
by the name of Willard Peck,

262
00:22:56,018 --> 00:22:58,603
with a price on his head of $200.

263
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:01,732
Now that's $200, dead or alive.

264
00:23:01,898 --> 00:23:03,233
The hell, you say!

265
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:07,446
I'm aware this is probably
disconcerting news.

266
00:23:07,612 --> 00:23:10,782
But I'm willing to wager
this man was elected sheriff

267
00:23:10,949 --> 00:23:13,452
sometime in the past two years?

268
00:23:14,369 --> 00:23:15,370
Yeah.

269
00:23:15,537 --> 00:23:18,957
[Schultz] I know this because three
years ago, he was rustling cattle

270
00:23:19,124 --> 00:23:22,586
from the B.C. Corrigan Cattle Company
of Lubbock, Texas.

271
00:23:22,753 --> 00:23:26,548
Now, this is a warrant
made out by

272
00:23:26,715 --> 00:23:32,387
Circuit Court Judge Henry Allen
Laudermilk of Austin, Texas.

273
00:23:32,554 --> 00:23:34,264
You're encouraged to wire him.

274
00:23:34,431 --> 00:23:39,478
He'll back up who I am and
who your dear departed sheriff was.

275
00:23:39,644 --> 00:23:43,607
[guns uncocking]

276
00:23:47,652 --> 00:23:51,573
In other words, marshal,
you owe me $200.

277
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:54,659
[medium-tempo song plays]

278
00:24:00,248 --> 00:24:01,750
I'll be damned.

279
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:33,365
After this Brittle business
is behind us,

280
00:24:33,532 --> 00:24:39,079
you'll be a free man, with a horse,
$75 in your back pocket...

281
00:24:41,873 --> 00:24:43,291
What's your plan after that?

282
00:24:45,544 --> 00:24:49,381
Find my wife, and buy her freedom.

283
00:24:51,633 --> 00:24:56,513
Django, I had no idea
you were a married man.

284
00:24:57,013 --> 00:24:59,307
Do most slaves believe in marriage?

285
00:24:59,474 --> 00:25:03,061
Oh, me and my wife do.

286
00:25:03,228 --> 00:25:07,399
Old Man Carrucan didn't.
That's why we, uh... we run off.

287
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:10,235
[man] Django.

288
00:25:10,902 --> 00:25:13,488
Django, Django-

289
00:25:13,655 --> 00:25:16,366
You got sand, Django.

290
00:25:17,075 --> 00:25:18,952
Boy's got sand.

291
00:25:20,745 --> 00:25:23,874
I got no use for a nigger with sand.

292
00:25:25,584 --> 00:25:29,087
I want you to burn a runaway "r"
right here on his cheek.

293
00:25:29,254 --> 00:25:30,297
And the girl, too.

294
00:25:30,463 --> 00:25:32,257
[groaning]

295
00:25:32,424 --> 00:25:37,220
And I want you to take 'em to
the Greenville auction and sell 'em.

296
00:25:38,054 --> 00:25:39,931
Both of 'em.

297
00:25:40,098 --> 00:25:41,850
Separately.

298
00:25:44,311 --> 00:25:45,645
And this one...

299
00:25:48,273 --> 00:25:50,984
...you will sell him cheap.

300
00:25:52,944 --> 00:25:54,446
In Greenville...

301
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:59,951
...there should be some sort
of a records office.

302
00:26:07,167 --> 00:26:09,377
You know when she was sold...

303
00:26:10,837 --> 00:26:13,798
...you know where she came from,

304
00:26:13,965 --> 00:26:15,800
and you know her name.

305
00:26:16,593 --> 00:26:18,136
What is her name?

306
00:26:18,303 --> 00:26:19,971
Broomhilda.

307
00:26:21,556 --> 00:26:24,809
- What?
- Broom-hilda.

308
00:26:24,976 --> 00:26:26,937
- Broomhilda?
- Hm-mm.

309
00:26:29,022 --> 00:26:32,025
- Were her owners German?
- Yeah, how you know?

310
00:26:32,901 --> 00:26:34,319
She wasn't born on
the Carrucan plantation.

311
00:26:34,486 --> 00:26:37,030
She was raised by a German mistress,
the Von Shafts.

312
00:26:37,197 --> 00:26:39,324
She speak a little German, too.

313
00:26:39,491 --> 00:26:41,243
- Your wife?
- Hm-mm.

314
00:26:41,409 --> 00:26:43,245
When she was little, her mistress
taught her so she'd have somebody

315
00:26:43,411 --> 00:26:44,996
to speak German with.

316
00:26:46,581 --> 00:26:49,167
Well, let me get this straight.

317
00:26:49,334 --> 00:26:53,922
Your slave wife speaks German
and her name is Broomhilda Von Shaft?

318
00:26:54,089 --> 00:26:55,215
Yep.

319
00:26:59,261 --> 00:27:02,013
They call me Hildi.

320
00:27:10,605 --> 00:27:12,524
[rooster crowing nearby]

321
00:27:18,697 --> 00:27:24,286
When we gain access to these
plantations, we'll be putting on an act.

322
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:28,373
You'll be playing a character.

323
00:27:35,255 --> 00:27:36,381
Hm?

324
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:38,508
No?

325
00:27:45,515 --> 00:27:49,978
During the act, you can
never break character.

326
00:27:51,062 --> 00:27:52,605
Do you understand?

327
00:27:53,356 --> 00:27:55,900
Yeah. Don't break character.

328
00:27:58,236 --> 00:28:02,157
And your character
is that of The Valet.

329
00:28:02,907 --> 00:28:04,409
What that is?

330
00:28:05,327 --> 00:28:07,704
That's a fancy word for servant.

331
00:28:07,871 --> 00:28:09,122
- Valet?
- Hm-mm.

332
00:28:09,289 --> 00:28:10,457
[chuckles]

333
00:28:10,623 --> 00:28:15,128
And now, Django, you may choose
your character's costume.

334
00:28:17,547 --> 00:28:19,382
Youse gonna let me
pick out my own clothes?

335
00:28:19,549 --> 00:28:20,508
But of course.

336
00:28:20,675 --> 00:28:24,346
[medium-tempo song
resumes playing]

337
00:28:49,287 --> 00:28:50,497
Whoa.

338
00:28:54,793 --> 00:28:58,380
It's against the law for niggers
to ride horses in this territory.

339
00:28:58,546 --> 00:29:01,925
This is my valet.
My valet does not walk.

340
00:29:02,092 --> 00:29:05,970
- I said niggers on horses...
- [Schultz] His name is Django.

341
00:29:06,137 --> 00:29:08,932
He's a free man.
He can ride what he pleases.

342
00:29:09,099 --> 00:29:12,560
Not on my property.
Not around my niggers, he can't.

343
00:29:13,228 --> 00:29:18,233
My good sir,
perhaps we got off on the wrong boot.

344
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,860
Allow me to unring this bell.

345
00:29:21,027 --> 00:29:24,864
My name is Dr. King Schultz.
This is my valet, Django.

346
00:29:25,031 --> 00:29:27,158
And these are our horses,
Tony and Fritz.

347
00:29:27,325 --> 00:29:29,160
- [snorting]
- [women giggling]

348
00:29:30,995 --> 00:29:32,372
Mr. Bennett?

349
00:29:32,539 --> 00:29:36,751
I've been led to believe that you
are a gentleman and a businessman.

350
00:29:36,918 --> 00:29:40,880
And it is for these attributes
we've ridden from Texas to Tennessee

351
00:29:41,047 --> 00:29:42,966
to parley with you now.

352
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:48,096
I wish to purchase
one of your nigger gals.

353
00:29:49,639 --> 00:29:52,725
You and your Jimmie
rode from Texas to Tennessee

354
00:29:52,892 --> 00:29:54,686
to buy one of my nigger gals?

355
00:29:54,853 --> 00:29:56,521
No appointment, no nothin'?

356
00:29:56,688 --> 00:29:58,606
Oh, I'm afraid so.

357
00:29:58,773 --> 00:30:01,192
Well, what if I was to say
I don't like you?

358
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:03,027
Or your fancy-pants nigger?

359
00:30:03,194 --> 00:30:05,405
And I wouldn't sell you a tinker's damn.

360
00:30:05,572 --> 00:30:07,532
Now what you got to say about that?

361
00:30:10,869 --> 00:30:12,787
Mr. Bennett.

362
00:30:12,954 --> 00:30:16,207
If you are the businessman
I've been led to believe you to be,

363
00:30:16,374 --> 00:30:21,546
I have 5,000 things I might say
that could change your mind.

364
00:30:22,964 --> 00:30:24,007
[chuckles softly]

365
00:30:25,758 --> 00:30:29,220
Well, come on inside and get
yourself somethin' cool to drink.

366
00:30:31,222 --> 00:30:32,307
Hm-mm.

367
00:30:35,977 --> 00:30:37,061
[chuckles]

368
00:30:43,735 --> 00:30:45,695
Oh, maybe while we discuss business,

369
00:30:45,862 --> 00:30:48,406
you could provide one of
your loveliest black creatures

370
00:30:48,573 --> 00:30:50,950
to escort Django here
around your magnificent grounds.

371
00:30:51,117 --> 00:30:53,286
Oh, well, absolutely!
Uh, Betina.

372
00:30:53,453 --> 00:30:55,205
- Yessir, Big Daddy?
- Uh...

373
00:30:55,371 --> 00:30:57,248
What's your Jimmie's name again?

374
00:30:57,415 --> 00:30:58,917
<i>'</i> Django.
<i>'</i> Django.

375
00:30:59,083 --> 00:31:01,252
Betina, sugar, could you
take Django there

376
00:31:01,419 --> 00:31:04,631
and take him around the grounds here
and show him all the pretty stuff.

377
00:31:04,797 --> 00:31:06,090
As you please, Big Daddy.

378
00:31:06,257 --> 00:31:10,178
Oh, Mr. Bennett, I must remind you,
Django is a free man.

379
00:31:10,345 --> 00:31:13,681
He cannot be treated like a slave.
He... within the bounds of good taste,

380
00:31:13,848 --> 00:31:16,351
he must be treated
as an extension of myself.

381
00:31:16,518 --> 00:31:19,521
- Understood, Schultz. Betina, sugar?
- Yes'm?

382
00:31:19,687 --> 00:31:24,317
Django isn't a slave.
Django is a free man, you understand?

383
00:31:25,652 --> 00:31:27,820
You can't treat him like any
of the other niggers around here,

384
00:31:27,987 --> 00:31:30,907
'cause he ain't like any of the
other niggers around here. You got it?

385
00:31:31,074 --> 00:31:33,952
You want I should
treat him like white folks?

386
00:31:34,118 --> 00:31:37,247
No. That's not what I said.

387
00:31:37,413 --> 00:31:39,958
Then I don't know what you want,
Big Daddy.

388
00:31:40,458 --> 00:31:44,963
Yes, I can see that. Uh...

389
00:31:45,129 --> 00:31:49,592
What's the name of that peckerwood boy
from town that works with the glass?

390
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:51,719
His mama work over at the lumberyard.

391
00:31:51,886 --> 00:31:54,639
- Oh, you mean Jerry.
- That's the boy's name. Jerry!

392
00:31:54,806 --> 00:31:56,307
You know Jerry, don't you, sugar?

393
00:31:56,474 --> 00:31:59,602
- Yes'm, Big Daddy.
- Well, that's it, then.

394
00:31:59,769 --> 00:32:02,730
You just treat him like you would Jerry.

395
00:32:02,939 --> 00:32:06,234
[playing medium-tempo tune]

396
00:32:09,696 --> 00:32:12,407
That house we just left from
is The Big House.

397
00:32:12,574 --> 00:32:15,493
Big Daddy call it that 'cause it's big.

398
00:32:16,661 --> 00:32:18,830
That there is the pantry.

399
00:32:18,997 --> 00:32:22,500
That's where Big Daddy
hang all his dead meat.

400
00:32:22,667 --> 00:32:24,711
Po' little squirrels.

401
00:32:26,421 --> 00:32:28,840
What you do for your massa?

402
00:32:29,007 --> 00:32:30,758
Didn't you hear him tell you
I ain't no slave?

403
00:32:30,925 --> 00:32:33,344
- So you really free?
- Yes, I's free.

404
00:32:33,511 --> 00:32:35,847
You mean you wanna dress like that?

405
00:32:37,682 --> 00:32:40,143
- Betina, I need to ask you somethin'.
- What you want?

406
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:43,396
I'm lookin' for three white men.
Three brothers. Overseers.

407
00:32:43,563 --> 00:32:45,023
Their name is Brittle. You know 'em?

408
00:32:45,189 --> 00:32:47,066
- Brittle?
- Yes, Brittle.

409
00:32:47,233 --> 00:32:51,529
John Brittle, Ellis Brittle,
Roger Brittle, sometime called Lil Raj.

410
00:32:51,696 --> 00:32:53,531
I don't know them.

411
00:32:54,115 --> 00:32:55,950
They could be usin' a different name.

412
00:32:56,117 --> 00:32:58,369
They woulda come to the plantation
this past year.

413
00:32:58,536 --> 00:33:01,164
- You mean the Shaffers?
- Maybe.

414
00:33:01,331 --> 00:33:03,458
- Three brothers?
- Uh-huh.

415
00:33:03,625 --> 00:33:05,376
- They here?
- Uh-huh.

416
00:33:05,543 --> 00:33:07,295
Could you point one of 'em out to me?

417
00:33:07,462 --> 00:33:09,756
Well, one's over in that field.

418
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,556
[medium-tempo song plays]

419
00:33:23,853 --> 00:33:25,438
[Django] Old Man Carrucan ain't
gonna appreciate this, now.

420
00:33:25,605 --> 00:33:26,564
She work in the house, John.

421
00:33:26,731 --> 00:33:28,608
You could mess her skin up,
and you gonna mess her up

422
00:33:28,775 --> 00:33:30,735
and she ain't gonna be worth...
she ain't gonna be worth a damn thing.

423
00:33:30,902 --> 00:33:32,779
Now, your Bible say...

424
00:33:37,367 --> 00:33:39,535
[Django] Look, I told you
that I was one that made her do it.

425
00:33:39,702 --> 00:33:41,329
You ready?

426
00:33:41,496 --> 00:33:43,790
She didn't wanna run off with me. If
anybody should be gettin' whupped now,

427
00:33:43,956 --> 00:33:45,333
it should be me. It should be me, John.

428
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:48,461
Now, I been here long enough, you know
me, you know me a long time, now.

429
00:33:48,628 --> 00:33:51,214
[dogs barking in distance]

430
00:33:58,221 --> 00:34:00,181
You know Massa Carrucan
ain't gonna appreciate this.

431
00:34:00,348 --> 00:34:01,974
She's a... she's a house slave.

432
00:34:02,141 --> 00:34:05,561
- She a house slave, she can't be...
- [screaming]

433
00:34:09,649 --> 00:34:11,567
[dogs howling]

434
00:34:18,116 --> 00:34:20,451
[screaming]

435
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:27,417
On my knees. I'm asking you this,
please. Ain't this what you want?

436
00:34:27,583 --> 00:34:29,460
I'm keeping it funny for you.
Now, John, please.

437
00:34:29,627 --> 00:34:32,422
[gasping sobbing]

438
00:34:35,425 --> 00:34:36,551
L's on my knees, John.

439
00:34:36,718 --> 00:34:38,678
I like the way you beg, boy.

440
00:34:38,845 --> 00:34:41,347
[whip cracking, echoing]

441
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,976
Is that who you was lookin' for?

442
00:34:46,811 --> 00:34:47,979
Yep.

443
00:34:49,272 --> 00:34:50,565
Where the other two at?

444
00:34:50,732 --> 00:34:54,485
They by the stable,
punishin' Little Jody for breakin' eggs.

445
00:34:54,652 --> 00:34:56,320
They whippin' Little Jody?

446
00:34:56,946 --> 00:34:58,823
Point me in that direction.

447
00:34:59,323 --> 00:35:02,535
You go to that tree
and keep goin' that-a way.

448
00:35:07,165 --> 00:35:09,250
Go get that white man
I came here with.

449
00:35:10,877 --> 00:35:12,170
- [man] Come on, now.
- No, no, please!

450
00:35:12,336 --> 00:35:13,838
- Come on, girlie.
- [shrieks] Please!

451
00:35:14,005 --> 00:35:16,549
- Come on. Get you set up now.
- [screaming]

452
00:35:16,716 --> 00:35:19,177
"And the Lord said,
'The fear of ye..."

453
00:35:19,343 --> 00:35:22,305
- [cracking]
- "...and the dread of ye

454
00:35:22,472 --> 00:35:24,766
shall be on every beast
of the earth."'

455
00:35:24,932 --> 00:35:25,892
[cracking]

456
00:35:26,058 --> 00:35:27,435
Come here now, woman!

457
00:35:27,602 --> 00:35:30,688
- You'd better give me that arm!
- [screaming]

458
00:35:47,872 --> 00:35:49,624
OK, she's ready!

459
00:35:51,709 --> 00:35:54,003
[whimpering]

460
00:36:03,721 --> 00:36:07,725
And after this, we'll see
if you break eggs again.

461
00:36:11,145 --> 00:36:13,064
John Brittle!

462
00:36:33,626 --> 00:36:36,295
- You remember me?
- [metal springing noise]

463
00:36:47,223 --> 00:36:49,600
I like the way you die, boy.

464
00:36:55,356 --> 00:36:57,900
Goddamn son of a bitch!

465
00:37:06,951 --> 00:37:08,744
[grunting]

466
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:10,788
[whip cracking]

467
00:37:11,497 --> 00:37:12,582
[groaning]

468
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,420
- Keep it funny!
- [grunting]

469
00:37:21,299 --> 00:37:23,009
[yelling]

470
00:37:32,059 --> 00:37:33,644
[man groaning]

471
00:37:42,987 --> 00:37:44,447
Y'all wanna see somethin'?

472
00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:46,699
[cocking pistol]

473
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:49,619
No! [groans]

474
00:37:54,123 --> 00:37:55,541
[clicking]

475
00:37:59,754 --> 00:38:01,297
Who were they?

476
00:38:02,006 --> 00:38:05,009
That's Big John,
and that's Lil Raj.

477
00:38:05,176 --> 00:38:06,677
Where's Ellis?

478
00:38:06,844 --> 00:38:09,180
He's the one hightailin' it
across that field right now.

479
00:38:14,018 --> 00:38:15,519
- You sure that's him?
- Yeah.

480
00:38:15,686 --> 00:38:17,605
- Positive?
- I don't know.

481
00:38:17,772 --> 00:38:20,024
- You don't know if you're positive?
- I don't know what "positive" mean.

482
00:38:20,191 --> 00:38:21,442
- It means you're sure.
- Yes.

483
00:38:21,609 --> 00:38:23,903
- "Yes," what?
- Yes, I'm sure that's Ellis Brittle.

484
00:38:37,124 --> 00:38:38,709
I'm positive he dead.

485
00:38:43,756 --> 00:38:44,757
Django!

486
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:48,970
Everybody calm down.

487
00:38:49,136 --> 00:38:51,389
We mean no one else any harm.

488
00:38:51,555 --> 00:38:53,099
Who are you two jokers?

489
00:38:53,265 --> 00:38:56,268
I am Dr. King Schultz,
a legal representative

490
00:38:56,435 --> 00:38:59,105
of the criminal justice system of
the United States of America.

491
00:38:59,271 --> 00:39:03,859
The man to my left is Django Freeman.
He's my deputy.

492
00:39:04,026 --> 00:39:05,987
In my pocket is a warrant,

493
00:39:06,153 --> 00:39:10,241
signed by Circuit Court Judge
Henry Allen Laudermilk of Austin, Texas,

494
00:39:10,408 --> 00:39:14,286
for the arrest and capture,
dead or alive,

495
00:39:14,453 --> 00:39:19,458
of John Brittle,
Roger Brittle and Ellis Brittle.

496
00:39:19,625 --> 00:39:21,711
They were goin' by the name Shaffer.

497
00:39:23,129 --> 00:39:27,258
You know them by the name of Shaffer,
but the butchers' real name was Brittle.

498
00:39:27,425 --> 00:39:29,093
These are wanted men.

499
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:30,720
The law wants 'em for murder.

500
00:39:30,886 --> 00:39:35,016
Now, I reiterate, the warrant
states dead or alive,

501
00:39:35,182 --> 00:39:38,477
so when Mr. Freeman and myself
executed these men on sight,

502
00:39:38,644 --> 00:39:42,106
we were operating
within our legal boundaries.

503
00:39:43,232 --> 00:39:47,611
I realize passions are high,

504
00:39:47,778 --> 00:39:51,824
but I must warn you,
the penalty for taking deadly force

505
00:39:51,991 --> 00:39:54,368
against an officer of the court
in the performance of his duty

506
00:39:54,535 --> 00:39:58,456
is you'll be hung by the neck
until you're dead.

507
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:06,213
Now, may I please remove the warrant
from my pocket so you may examine it?

508
00:40:08,299 --> 00:40:09,425
Gimme.

509
00:40:25,983 --> 00:40:27,318
Satisfied?

510
00:40:33,824 --> 00:40:36,118
May I have that back, please?

511
00:40:41,832 --> 00:40:44,835
- Get off my land.
- Posthaste.

512
00:40:45,503 --> 00:40:49,924
Load up the bodies as quickly as you can
and let's get outta here.

513
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:55,471
[Schultz whistling indistinctly]

514
00:41:15,783 --> 00:41:19,286
Yeah, that's them sons-a-bitches.

515
00:41:27,169 --> 00:41:30,548
[galloping hoofbeats]

516
00:41:32,383 --> 00:41:36,679
- [dramatic choral music]
- [horses snorting, whinnying]

517
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:47,565
[men yelling, whooping]

518
00:41:59,326 --> 00:42:00,578
Come on, men!

519
00:42:02,788 --> 00:42:06,292
- [man 1] We're coming for you, nigger!
- [man 2] Hee-haw!

520
00:42:15,509 --> 00:42:19,930
Now, unless they start shootin' first,
nobody shoot 'em.

521
00:42:20,097 --> 00:42:22,308
That's way too simple for these jokers.

522
00:42:23,058 --> 00:42:25,686
We're gonna whup that
nigger-lover to death.

523
00:42:25,853 --> 00:42:30,900
And I'm gonna personally
strip and clip that garboon myself.

524
00:42:34,778 --> 00:42:35,988
Damn.

525
00:42:37,323 --> 00:42:39,950
I can't see fuckin' shit
outta this thing.

526
00:42:40,868 --> 00:42:42,161
We ready or what?

527
00:42:42,328 --> 00:42:44,705
[Big Daddy] Aw, hold on,
I'm fuckin' with my eyeholes.

528
00:42:44,872 --> 00:42:47,249
- [fabric ripping]
- Oh... Oh, shit.

529
00:42:47,416 --> 00:42:49,627
I just made it worse.

530
00:42:49,793 --> 00:42:51,837
Who made this goddamn shit?

531
00:42:52,004 --> 00:42:54,965
- Willard's wife.
- Well, make your own goddamn masks!

532
00:42:55,132 --> 00:42:58,719
Look, nobody's sayin'
they don't appreciate what Jenny did.

533
00:42:58,886 --> 00:43:01,472
Well, if all I had to do
was cut a hole in a bag,

534
00:43:01,639 --> 00:43:03,307
I coulda cut it better than this!

535
00:43:03,474 --> 00:43:06,268
What about you, Robert?
Can you see?

536
00:43:06,435 --> 00:43:07,645
Not too good.

537
00:43:07,811 --> 00:43:12,149
I mean, if I don't move my head I can
see you pretty good, more or less.

538
00:43:12,316 --> 00:43:15,819
But when I start ridin', the bag's
movin' all over, and I'm ridin' blind.

539
00:43:15,986 --> 00:43:18,072
- Shit.
- [man] Yeah.

540
00:43:18,614 --> 00:43:20,282
I just made mine worse.

541
00:43:21,116 --> 00:43:22,243
Oh, God.

542
00:43:22,409 --> 00:43:23,953
Anybody bring any extra bags?

543
00:43:24,119 --> 00:43:27,081
No, nobody brought an extra bag!

544
00:43:27,248 --> 00:43:28,874
I'm just askin'.

545
00:43:29,041 --> 00:43:30,834
Do we have to wear 'em when we ride?

546
00:43:31,001 --> 00:43:32,211
Oh, well, shitfire!

547
00:43:32,378 --> 00:43:35,464
If you don't wear 'em as you ride up,
that just defeats the purpose!

548
00:43:35,631 --> 00:43:37,591
Well, I can't see
in this fuckin' thing!

549
00:43:37,758 --> 00:43:40,469
I can't breathe in this fuckin' thing
and I can't ride in this fuckin' thing!

550
00:43:40,636 --> 00:43:43,055
Well, fuck all y'all! I'm goin' home!

551
00:43:43,222 --> 00:43:47,017
Now, I watched my wife work all day
gettin' 30 bags together

552
00:43:47,184 --> 00:43:49,186
for you ungrateful sons-a-bitches,

553
00:43:49,353 --> 00:43:53,107
and all I can hear is
criticize, criticize, criticize!

554
00:43:53,274 --> 00:43:56,443
From now on, don't ask me
or mine for nothin'!

555
00:43:57,736 --> 00:44:00,614
Now, look, let's not forget
why we're here.

556
00:44:00,781 --> 00:44:03,867
We got a killer nigger
over that hill there!

557
00:44:04,034 --> 00:44:05,369
And we gotta make a lesson out of him.

558
00:44:05,536 --> 00:44:09,373
OK, I'm confused.
Are the bags on or off?

559
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:14,336
I think we all think
the bag was a nice idea.

560
00:44:14,503 --> 00:44:15,462
- Yeah.
- [mumbling agreements]

561
00:44:15,629 --> 00:44:19,717
But, not pointin' any fingers,
they coulda been done better.

562
00:44:20,676 --> 00:44:24,388
So how 'bout no bags this time,

563
00:44:24,555 --> 00:44:29,560
but next time we do the bags right
and then we go full regalia.

564
00:44:29,727 --> 00:44:31,729
- I like that idea a lot.
- You get my vote, Robert.

565
00:44:31,895 --> 00:44:35,232
Wait a minute!
I didn't say no bags.

566
00:44:35,399 --> 00:44:37,401
But nobody can see.

567
00:44:37,568 --> 00:44:38,652
So?

568
00:44:38,819 --> 00:44:40,696
So it'd be nice to see.

569
00:44:40,863 --> 00:44:45,617
Goddamn it! This is a raid!
I can't see, you can't see!

570
00:44:45,784 --> 00:44:51,165
So what? All that matters is can
the fuckin' horse see! That's a raid!

571
00:44:51,332 --> 00:44:54,126
- [overlapping shouts]
- [man] Sons of bitches!

572
00:44:54,918 --> 00:44:56,628
I can't see shit!

573
00:44:56,795 --> 00:45:00,424
[Big Daddy] There he is! Get that nigger
out from under that wagon!

574
00:45:01,258 --> 00:45:03,260
And get that nigger-lover
outta the wagon!

575
00:45:03,427 --> 00:45:05,054
That nigger ain't down here,
Big Daddy!

576
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:06,638
- What?
- They tricked us!

577
00:45:06,805 --> 00:45:07,848
Well, where are they?

578
00:45:08,015 --> 00:45:09,433
Auf Wiedersehen.

579
00:45:10,893 --> 00:45:13,187
- [all shouting]
- [horses whinnying]

580
00:45:15,147 --> 00:45:16,940
Oh! [chuckles]

581
00:45:17,107 --> 00:45:18,150
Bull's-eye.

582
00:45:18,317 --> 00:45:20,986
- [men yelling]
- [horses whinnying]

583
00:45:21,153 --> 00:45:24,448
- [Django] Look at 'em run.
- [all shouting]

584
00:45:27,076 --> 00:45:29,661
Yeah, cowards tend to do that.

585
00:45:29,828 --> 00:45:31,789
Goddamn it!

586
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,171
[Big Daddy] Goddamn it!

587
00:45:43,801 --> 00:45:45,511
Would you care to?

588
00:45:52,309 --> 00:45:54,144
Can't see shit outta this!

589
00:45:54,770 --> 00:45:56,939
- He's getting away.
- I got him.

590
00:45:58,982 --> 00:46:00,442
[Schultz]
Big Daddy's getting away.

591
00:46:00,609 --> 00:46:01,860
I got him.

592
00:46:06,323 --> 00:46:08,826
- [slow-motion impact sound]
- [Big Daddy grunting]

593
00:46:17,126 --> 00:46:18,168
Got him.

594
00:46:23,006 --> 00:46:26,009
[chuckles] The kid's a natural.

595
00:46:30,681 --> 00:46:32,349
[animal yipping nearby]

596
00:46:36,687 --> 00:46:40,482
How you know Broomhilda's
first masters was German?

597
00:46:40,649 --> 00:46:42,901
Broomhilda is a German name.

598
00:46:43,068 --> 00:46:45,779
If they named her,
it stands to reason they'd be German.

599
00:46:45,946 --> 00:46:48,198
Lots of gals where you're from
named Broomhilda?

600
00:46:48,991 --> 00:46:51,952
Broomhilda is the name of a character

601
00:46:52,119 --> 00:46:56,039
in the most popular
of all the German legends.

602
00:46:56,206 --> 00:46:58,167
There's a story about Broomhilda?

603
00:46:58,333 --> 00:47:00,043
Oh, yes, there is.

604
00:47:06,091 --> 00:47:09,553
- Do you know it?
- Oh, every German knows that story.

605
00:47:15,976 --> 00:47:17,352
Would you like me to tell you?

606
00:47:18,854 --> 00:47:24,860
Well, Broomhilda was a princess.

607
00:47:26,695 --> 00:47:30,782
She was a daughter of Wotan,
god of all gods.

608
00:47:31,825 --> 00:47:35,037
Anyway, her father is really mad at her.

609
00:47:35,204 --> 00:47:36,455
What she do?

610
00:47:37,414 --> 00:47:38,874
I can't exactly remember.

611
00:47:39,041 --> 00:47:41,710
She disobeys him in some way.

612
00:47:41,877 --> 00:47:45,047
So he puts her on top of the mountain.

613
00:47:45,714 --> 00:47:46,840
Broomhilda's on a mountain?

614
00:47:47,007 --> 00:47:48,258
It's a German legend,

615
00:47:48,425 --> 00:47:51,220
there's always going to be
a mountain in there somewhere.

616
00:47:51,386 --> 00:47:55,432
And he puts a fire-breathing dragon
there to guard the mountain.

617
00:47:57,100 --> 00:48:02,189
And he surrounds her
in a circle of hellfire.

618
00:48:03,649 --> 00:48:07,986
And there, Broomhilda shall remain.

619
00:48:09,279 --> 00:48:14,576
Unless a hero arises
brave enough to save her.

620
00:48:15,661 --> 00:48:17,246
Does a fella arise?

621
00:48:17,412 --> 00:48:20,374
Yes, Django, as a matter of fact,
he does.

622
00:48:20,541 --> 00:48:22,584
A fella named Siegfried.

623
00:48:23,293 --> 00:48:24,294
Does Siegfried save her?

624
00:48:26,463 --> 00:48:29,091
Quite spectacularly so.

625
00:48:30,133 --> 00:48:34,263
He scales the mountain,
because he's not afraid of it.

626
00:48:34,972 --> 00:48:39,142
He slays the dragon,
because he's not afraid of him.

627
00:48:39,309 --> 00:48:41,812
And he walks through hellfire...

628
00:48:44,147 --> 00:48:46,525
...because Broomhilda's worth it.

629
00:48:50,654 --> 00:48:52,322
I know how he feel.

630
00:48:53,782 --> 00:48:56,660
I think I'm just
starting to realize that.

631
00:49:02,165 --> 00:49:06,336
Now, look, Django...

632
00:49:09,256 --> 00:49:13,302
...I don't doubt that one day
you'll save your lady love...

633
00:49:14,428 --> 00:49:18,015
...but I can't let you go to
Greenville in a good conscience.

634
00:49:19,057 --> 00:49:23,520
A slave auction town in Mississippi
isn't the place for you to visit.

635
00:49:23,687 --> 00:49:26,565
Free or not, it's just too dangerous.

636
00:49:29,526 --> 00:49:31,695
But let me ask you a question.

637
00:49:39,202 --> 00:49:41,622
How do you like the
bounty hunting business?

638
00:49:43,123 --> 00:49:45,459
Kill white folks
and they pay you for it?

639
00:49:46,293 --> 00:49:47,628
What's not to like?

640
00:49:47,794 --> 00:49:50,213
Now, I have to admit,
we make a good team.

641
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:53,216
I thought you was mad at me
for killin' Big John and Lil Raj.

642
00:49:53,383 --> 00:49:55,469
Yeah, on that occasion
you were a tad overzealous,

643
00:49:55,636 --> 00:49:57,596
but normally, that's a good thing.

644
00:49:58,388 --> 00:50:00,599
How'd you like to partner up
for the winter?

645
00:50:00,766 --> 00:50:02,768
What you mean "partner up"?

646
00:50:02,934 --> 00:50:07,230
You work with me through the winter
till the snow melts...

647
00:50:08,231 --> 00:50:10,233
...I give you a third of my bounties.

648
00:50:11,443 --> 00:50:15,364
So we make some money this winter,
and when the snow melts,

649
00:50:15,530 --> 00:50:18,450
I'll take you to Greenville myself

650
00:50:18,617 --> 00:50:21,828
and we'll find
where they sent your wife.

651
00:50:26,083 --> 00:50:27,834
Why you care what happen to me?

652
00:50:29,586 --> 00:50:31,546
Why you care if I find my wife?

653
00:50:31,713 --> 00:50:33,090
Frankly...

654
00:50:34,383 --> 00:50:37,260
...I've never given anybody
their freedom before.

655
00:50:37,427 --> 00:50:41,264
And now that I have,
I feel vaguely responsible for you.

656
00:50:42,516 --> 00:50:46,228
Plus, when a German meets a real life
Siegfried, that's kind of a big deal.

657
00:50:48,772 --> 00:50:51,650
As a German, I'm obliged
to help you on your quest

658
00:50:51,817 --> 00:50:54,444
to rescue your beloved Broomhilda.

659
00:51:01,201 --> 00:51:04,371
[medium-tempo song plays]

660
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:04,741
[man] You got her.

661
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:16,461
Ooh. What happened to Mr. "I Wanna
Shoot White Folks For Money"?

662
00:53:16,628 --> 00:53:19,339
- His son's with him.
- Well, good.

663
00:53:19,506 --> 00:53:21,091
He'll have a loved one with him.

664
00:53:21,258 --> 00:53:23,760
Maybe even share a last word.

665
00:53:25,762 --> 00:53:27,806
That's better than most of them get.

666
00:53:27,973 --> 00:53:30,267
Damn sight better than he deserves.

667
00:53:38,441 --> 00:53:39,776
Put down the rifle.

668
00:53:42,779 --> 00:53:44,489
Don't worry, I'm not mad at you.

669
00:53:45,282 --> 00:53:47,617
Let's take out Smitty Bacall's handbill.

670
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:53,081
Read it aloud.

671
00:53:53,957 --> 00:53:55,750
Consider that today's lesson.

00:53:58,169 --> 00:54:00,839

687
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:51,473
That is who Smitty Bacall is.

688
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:54,517
If Smitty Bacall wanted
to start a farm at 22,

689
00:54:54,684 --> 00:54:56,645
they would never have printed that.

690
00:54:57,354 --> 00:55:00,774
But Smitty Bacall
wanted to rob stagecoaches

691
00:55:00,941 --> 00:55:03,360
and he didn't mind
killing people to do it.

692
00:55:04,027 --> 00:55:07,364
Do you want to save your wife
by doing what I do?

693
00:55:08,615 --> 00:55:10,075
This is what I do.

694
00:55:10,241 --> 00:55:13,787
I kill people and
sell their corpses for cash.

695
00:55:14,704 --> 00:55:18,500
This corpse is worth $7,000.

696
00:55:18,667 --> 00:55:20,877
Now quit your pussyfooting
and shoot him.

00:55:42,357 --> 00:55:44,067
Here.

702
00:55:44,234 --> 00:55:46,319
You need to keep this
Smitty Bacall handbill.

703
00:55:46,486 --> 00:55:48,571
- Why?
- It's good luck.

704
00:55:48,738 --> 00:55:51,533
You always keep the handbill
of your first bounty.

706
00:56:39,456 --> 00:56:40,874

711
00:57:53,363 --> 00:57:55,532
Who the hell-a you got there?

712
00:57:55,698 --> 00:57:57,659
[Schultz] The Wilson-Lowe Gang.

713
00:57:57,826 --> 00:58:00,829
Who the hell is the Wilson-Lowe Gang?

714
00:58:01,538 --> 00:58:06,084
Bad Chuck Wilson and meaner
Bobby Lowe and three of their acolytes.

715
00:58:06,251 --> 00:58:09,879
Huh. Well, just leave 'em out here,
they ain't going nowhere.

716
00:58:10,046 --> 00:58:12,423
Why don't you come in then
out of the snowy snow

717
00:58:12,590 --> 00:58:14,425
and get yourselves some coffee.

718
00:58:14,592 --> 00:58:17,137
We had a birthday yesterday.
Got some cake.

719
00:58:17,303 --> 00:58:18,721
Pretty good.

00:58:40,869 --> 00:58:43,204
[man 1] Move along!

722
00:58:48,543 --> 00:58:50,628
Move it, boy!

00:58:52,172 --> 00:58:53,423
[man 2] Keep movin'.

724

Get on up on that auction block.

Don't let that mud slow you down.
Keep going.

Calvin Candie.

730
00:59:29,209 --> 00:59:33,630
He owns the fourth biggest cotton
plantation in Mississippi: Candyland.

731
00:59:33,796 --> 00:59:35,131
Candyland?

732
00:59:35,298 --> 00:59:36,382
Oh, so you've heard of it.

733
00:59:36,549 --> 00:59:38,635
Ain't no slave ain't heard of Candyland.

734
00:59:38,801 --> 00:59:41,471
Well, apparently,
that's where your wife is...

735
00:59:41,638 --> 00:59:43,306
- [sighs]
- ...and that's the repellant gentleman

736
00:59:43,473 --> 00:59:47,018
who owns her. Let's just hope she
works in the house, not in the field.

737
00:59:47,185 --> 00:59:49,312
Oh, no, she ain't no field nigger.

738
00:59:49,479 --> 00:59:51,481
She... she pretty.

739
00:59:52,148 --> 00:59:54,067
And she talk good, too.

740
00:59:55,652 --> 00:59:57,445
But when they tore her back up
and then they...

741
00:59:58,655 --> 01:00:00,823
...burned that runaway "r"

They gonna try to
make her a comfort girl.

748
01:00:13,294 --> 01:00:15,171
What's a comfort...? Oh.

749
01:00:16,089 --> 01:00:17,382
Not while I got freedom.

750
01:00:18,967 --> 01:00:20,760
Not while I got my gun.

751
01:00:23,846 --> 01:00:25,556
So do we offer to buy her?

752
01:00:28,184 --> 01:00:29,560
So...

753
01:00:31,145 --> 01:00:32,814
...say...

754
01:00:34,983 --> 01:00:38,194
...a man wants to buy a horse.

755
01:00:38,361 --> 01:00:40,405
Needs to buy a horse.

756
01:00:41,364 --> 01:00:44,325
He walks up to the farmer's farm,
and he knocks on the farmer's door

757
01:00:44,492 --> 01:00:46,160
and asks the farmer to buy his horse.

758
01:00:46,327 --> 01:00:48,121
And do you know what the farmer says?

759
01:00:48,288 --> 01:00:50,498
The farmer says no.

760
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:56,963
Well, I say fuck that farmer,
and I'm stealin' that horse.

761
01:00:57,130 --> 01:01:01,259
Fair enough. But now you're a horse
thief, and they hang horse thieves.

762
01:01:01,426 --> 01:01:03,553
Not to mention the horse
goes back to its original owner

763
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:05,346
because the horse is still his property.

764
01:01:05,513 --> 01:01:09,392
We need her and we need a bill of sale.

765
01:01:09,559 --> 01:01:11,853
Well, if we ain't gonna try to buy her,
then how we gonna get her?

766
01:01:12,937 --> 01:01:16,524
May I offer an alternative
plan of action?

767
01:01:16,691 --> 01:01:18,192
Go ahead.

768
01:01:18,359 --> 01:01:22,905
So... the man walks up
to the farmer's farm,

769
01:01:23,072 --> 01:01:24,615
he knocks on the farmer's door...

770
01:01:25,325 --> 01:01:30,371
...and asks not to buy the horse,
but the farm.

771
01:01:30,538 --> 01:01:33,916
And makes an offer so ridiculous,

772
01:01:34,083 --> 01:01:36,878
the farmer is forced to say yes.

773
01:01:37,754 --> 01:01:40,506
- We gonna offer to buy Candyland?
- No, it's far too big.

774
01:01:40,673 --> 01:01:43,926
But apparently this farmer
ain't all about the farm.

775
01:01:45,386 --> 01:01:47,430
How much do you know
about Mandingo fighting?

776
01:01:47,597 --> 01:01:48,598
What?

777
01:01:48,765 --> 01:01:51,601
Can you convincingly
masquerade as someone

778
01:01:51,768 --> 01:01:53,436
who is an expert on Mandingo fighting?

779
01:01:53,603 --> 01:01:54,645
Why?

780
01:01:54,812 --> 01:01:58,441

of a big money buyer from Dusseldorf,</i>

into the Mandingo fight game.</i>

You want me to play a black slaver?

Ain't nothin' lower than a black slaver.

791
01:02:31,182 --> 01:02:34,644
A black slaver is lower
than the head house nigger...

792
01:02:35,311 --> 01:02:37,438
...and, buddy,
that's pretty fuckin' low.

793
01:02:38,564 --> 01:02:40,566
Then play him that way.

794
01:02:40,733 --> 01:02:44,779
Give me your black slaver.

- Good to see you again!
- Mr. Moguy.

800
01:03:01,587 --> 01:03:04,382
Thank you for your assistance
in creating the opportunity

801
01:03:04,549 --> 01:03:07,343
- for this appointment.
- Nonsense, it's my job.

802
01:03:07,510 --> 01:03:10,346
So this is the One-Eyed Charley
I've heard so much about.

803
01:03:10,513 --> 01:03:12,932
Yes, this is Django Freeman.

804
01:03:13,099 --> 01:03:15,768
Django, this is Mr. Candie's lawyer,
Leonide Moguy.

805
01:03:15,935 --> 01:03:17,895
Just call me Leo.

806
01:03:18,062 --> 01:03:21,232
Calvin's in the Julius Caesar room.
You all wanna follow me?

807
01:03:21,399 --> 01:03:23,693
[Schultz] How long have you been
associated with Mr. Candie?

808
01:03:23,860 --> 01:03:26,320
[Leo] Oh, Calvin's father and I
were about 11

809
01:03:26,487 --> 01:03:28,281
when we went to
boarding school together.

810
01:03:28,448 --> 01:03:31,534
Calvin's father's father
put me through law school.

811
01:03:31,701 --> 01:03:34,704
One could almost say
I was raised to be Calvin's lawyer.

812
01:03:34,871 --> 01:03:36,622
One could almost say youse a nigger.

813
01:03:37,498 --> 01:03:38,916
What did you say?

814
01:03:39,083 --> 01:03:41,836
- I said...
- Nothing, he's just being cheeky.

815
01:03:42,378 --> 01:03:46,799
Uh, anything else about Mr. Candie
that I should know before I meet him?

816
01:03:46,966 --> 01:03:48,968
Yes, he is a bit of a Francophile.

817
01:03:49,135 --> 01:03:50,928
[chuckles]
What civilized people aren't?

818
01:03:51,095 --> 01:03:53,347
And he prefers Monsieur Candie
to Mr. Candie.

[speaks French]

820
01:03:56,142 --> 01:04:00,146
He doesn't speak French. Don't speak
French to him, it'll embarrass him.

There you go.

825
01:04:10,656 --> 01:04:12,909
Why do you want to get in
the Mandingo business?

826
01:04:15,745 --> 01:04:19,499
You don't intend to allow your second
to make the proper introductions?

827
01:04:20,249 --> 01:04:22,126
Quit stalling, now.

828
01:04:22,293 --> 01:04:23,628
Answer the question.

829
01:04:26,297 --> 01:04:29,717
The awful truth? I'm bored.

830
01:04:29,884 --> 01:04:32,261
This seems like a good bit of fun.

831
01:04:37,183 --> 01:04:39,185
Well, come on over.

832
01:04:39,352 --> 01:04:42,063
We got us a fight goin' on

You don't wear a hat in the house,

- Dr. Schultz.
- What a rare pleasure.

838
01:05:09,966 --> 01:05:11,384
Keep fighting, niggers.

839
01:05:11,551 --> 01:05:14,345
- And I might add, an honor.
- Honor to meet you.

840
01:05:14,512 --> 01:05:16,430
Please have a seat,
the pleasure's all mine.

841
01:05:16,597 --> 01:05:20,101
Get free man Django here
whatever he wants.

842
01:05:20,268 --> 01:05:22,562
And I'll have sweet tea and bourbon.

Come on, now!

848
01:05:49,589 --> 01:05:52,091
He's not doing what I told him,
for God's sakes.

850

It's a fight to the death!

01:06:13,487 --> 01:06:15,031
[Calvin] Turn him around! Now...

856
01:06:18,826 --> 01:06:23,164
[Calvin] Use your strength, boy!
Come on, now! Use your strength!

857
01:06:23,331 --> 01:06:25,082
[man screaming]

858
01:06:25,249 --> 01:06:27,043
[Calvin] There you go!

859
01:06:28,377 --> 01:06:30,838
There you go! Look at that.

860
01:06:31,922 --> 01:06:34,884
See, I told you to put
some more power in there.

861
01:06:35,051 --> 01:06:37,094
Do what I told you, boy!

862
01:06:37,261 --> 01:06:38,721
- There you go!
- [bones cracking]

863
01:06:38,888 --> 01:06:41,182
- No!
- [Calvin] Do what I told ya!

864
01:06:41,349 --> 01:06:44,393
Blind him black, boy!
Blind him black!

865
01:06:44,560 --> 01:06:46,646
[man screaming]

866
01:06:46,812 --> 01:06:49,315
- Oh, no, Luigi.
- [screaming]

867
01:06:52,526 --> 01:06:56,447
- Whoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo!
- [screaming]

868
01:06:57,073 --> 01:06:58,240
Oh...

869
01:06:58,407 --> 01:07:01,243
- [panting]
- [man continues screaming]

870
01:07:05,373 --> 01:07:06,332
[playing pool]

871
01:07:06,499 --> 01:07:08,626
[screaming continues]

872
01:07:08,793 --> 01:07:10,086
Finish him.

873
01:07:14,382 --> 01:07:16,133
Go on, boy, finish him!

874
01:07:17,843 --> 01:07:19,095
[screaming halts]

875
01:07:20,638 --> 01:07:22,348
[Moguy] That's why they
call him Big Fred.

876
01:07:22,515 --> 01:07:25,935
- Worth every penny.
- Well, arrivederci, Luigi.

877
01:07:26,102 --> 01:07:28,312
Come on up, now, boy.
Get yourself a rest.

878
01:07:28,479 --> 01:07:31,482
You did a fine job.
A real fine job.

879
01:07:32,108 --> 01:07:33,818
Mercedes.

880
01:07:54,922 --> 01:07:56,132
Tequila.

881
01:08:06,142 --> 01:08:07,643
What's your name?

882
01:08:09,812 --> 01:08:11,313
Django.

883
01:08:13,733 --> 01:08:15,401
Can you spell it?

884
01:08:17,528 --> 01:08:21,574
D-J-A-N-G-O.

885
01:08:23,075 --> 01:08:24,577
The D is silent.

886
01:08:24,744 --> 01:08:26,328
I know.

887
01:08:33,043 --> 01:08:34,128
[speaks foreign language]

888
01:08:34,295 --> 01:08:37,798
[Calvin] Mr. Moguy, want you to
take care of my new boy here.

889
01:08:37,965 --> 01:08:39,675
You find him a room
with a soft bed,

890
01:08:39,842 --> 01:08:42,428
then you bring him up
a pony to lick his pole.

891
01:08:42,595 --> 01:08:45,347
But you be ready to travel to Candyland
tomorrow morning, now, ya hear?

892
01:08:45,514 --> 01:08:46,515
Yessir, Monsieur Candie.

893
01:08:46,682 --> 01:08:50,561
Before you go,
Roscoe, get Fred here a tall beer.

894
01:08:54,398 --> 01:08:57,401
You enjoy that, boy.
You've earned it.

895
01:08:57,568 --> 01:08:58,861
Yes sir.

896
01:09:08,370 --> 01:09:12,166
- What's your name, boy?
- His name is Django Freeman.

897
01:09:12,333 --> 01:09:13,542
[Calvin chuckles]

898
01:09:15,711 --> 01:09:17,338
Where'd you dig him up?

899
01:09:17,505 --> 01:09:20,758
A fortuitous turn of events
brought Django and myself together.

900
01:09:22,468 --> 01:09:24,553
I've heard tell about you.

901
01:09:25,304 --> 01:09:28,057
I heard you been telling everybody
them Mandingos ain't no damn good.

902
01:09:28,224 --> 01:09:30,351
Ain't nothin' nobody
is sellin' is worth buyin'.

903
01:09:30,518 --> 01:09:34,730
I'm curious... what makes you
such a Mandingo expert?

904
01:09:36,690 --> 01:09:39,109
I'm curious what makes you so curious.

905
01:09:42,404 --> 01:09:44,490
- What did you say, boy?
- Calm down, Butch.

906
01:09:45,533 --> 01:09:46,867
No offense given...

907
01:09:47,701 --> 01:09:48,911
...none taken.

908
01:09:49,078 --> 01:09:50,788
[Schultz] Monsieur Candie...

909
01:09:50,955 --> 01:09:54,458
...I'd appreciate if you could
direct your line of inquiry toward me.

910
01:09:54,625 --> 01:09:56,085
One...

911
01:09:56,710 --> 01:09:59,839
...you do not have anything to drink.
Can I get you a tasty refreshment?

912
01:10:00,005 --> 01:10:02,842
- Yes! I'll have a beer.
- Wunderbar.

913
01:10:03,008 --> 01:10:04,844
Roscoe, a beer
for the man with the beard,

914
01:10:05,010 --> 01:10:06,846
and I will have a
Polynesian Pearl Diver.

915
01:10:07,012 --> 01:10:09,098
Do not spare the rum.

916
01:10:09,265 --> 01:10:12,768
Doc... I am a seasoned slaver.

917
01:10:12,935 --> 01:10:14,645
You are, well, you are a neophyte.

918
01:10:14,812 --> 01:10:19,942
I'm simply tryin' to ascertain if this
cowboy here is takin' advantage of you.

919
01:10:21,402 --> 01:10:24,613
With all due respect, Monsieur Candie...

920
01:10:25,322 --> 01:10:27,199
...I didn't seek you
out for your advice.

921
01:10:27,366 --> 01:10:29,493
I sought you out to
purchase a fighting nigger

922
01:10:29,660 --> 01:10:32,204
at above top-dollar market price.

923
01:10:32,371 --> 01:10:34,915
Now I was under the impression,
when you granted me an audience,

924
01:10:35,082 --> 01:10:37,459
it would be to discuss business.

925
01:10:40,170 --> 01:10:42,631
Well, we weren't talkin' business yet.

926
01:10:42,798 --> 01:10:45,134
We were discussin' my curiosity.

927
01:10:47,428 --> 01:10:48,429
Thank you.

928
01:10:48,596 --> 01:10:51,307
[Calvin] Roscoe, Coco,
go outside and play.

929
01:10:53,309 --> 01:10:56,770
Sheba... you stay right there.

930
01:10:56,937 --> 01:10:58,480
I know you didn't mean me.

931
01:11:00,232 --> 01:11:02,735
- Prost!
- German.

932
01:11:03,652 --> 01:11:07,448
Now, according to Moguy,
if I do business with you,

933
01:11:07,615 --> 01:11:09,658
I'm doing business with both y'all.

934
01:11:09,825 --> 01:11:12,244
He does the eyeballin',
you the billfold? Is that it?

935
01:11:12,411 --> 01:11:16,165
Well, you don't make it sound
too flattering, but more or less, yeah.

936
01:11:16,332 --> 01:11:17,499
Hm.

937
01:11:18,792 --> 01:11:19,793
So...

938
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:21,879
...Bright Boy...

939
01:11:22,046 --> 01:11:24,006
...Moguy tells me
you looked over my African flesh

940
01:11:24,173 --> 01:11:26,342
and you was
none too impressed, huh?

941
01:11:26,508 --> 01:11:28,010
Not for top dollar.

942
01:11:30,179 --> 01:11:32,222
Well, then,
we got nothin' more to talk about.

943
01:11:32,389 --> 01:11:34,516
You see, you wanna buy
a beat-ass nigger from me,

944
01:11:34,683 --> 01:11:36,936
those are the beat-ass niggers
I wanna sell so...

945
01:11:37,102 --> 01:11:39,063
He don't wanna buy the niggers
you wanna sell.

946
01:11:40,022 --> 01:11:43,192
He wants the nigger
you don't wanna sell.

947
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:47,655
Well, I don't sell the niggers
I don't wanna sell.

948
01:11:49,907 --> 01:11:53,577
Well, you won't sell your best.

949
01:11:53,744 --> 01:11:56,163
You won't even sell your second best.

950
01:11:56,330 --> 01:12:00,000
But your third best...?
You don't want to sell him either.

951
01:12:00,167 --> 01:12:04,088
But if I made you an offer so ridiculous
you'd be forced to consider it...

952
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:06,924
[chortles]
...who knows what could happen?

953
01:12:09,259 --> 01:12:11,553
And what do you consider ridiculous?

954
01:12:12,554 --> 01:12:16,642
For a truly talented specimen,
the right nigger?

955
01:12:18,394 --> 01:12:20,437
How much would you say, Django?

956
01:12:23,816 --> 01:12:25,526
Twelve thousand dollars.

957
01:12:26,235 --> 01:12:27,903
[straw slurping]

958
01:12:30,072 --> 01:12:34,076
Well, gentlemen, you had my curiosity,

959
01:12:34,243 --> 01:12:36,161
but now you have my attention.

960
01:12:49,842 --> 01:12:55,514
Willie. Willie.
Hold up! Hold up. Ah!

961
01:12:55,681 --> 01:12:58,100
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good Dr. Schultz.

962
01:12:58,267 --> 01:13:02,187
- Beautiful morning, isn't it?
- You couldn't have picked a better one.

963
01:13:02,354 --> 01:13:05,232
Please, won't you take a ride with us
here in the Victoria.

964
01:13:05,399 --> 01:13:06,942
[Schultz]
Oh, thank you very much.

965
01:13:07,109 --> 01:13:09,236
You can tie your horse up back there.

966
01:13:17,453 --> 01:13:18,746
[Calvin] Django.

967
01:13:23,542 --> 01:13:27,171
Where I part company from many
of my phrenologist colleagues

968
01:13:27,337 --> 01:13:32,509
is I believe there is a level
above bright, above talented,

969
01:13:32,676 --> 01:13:36,805
above loyal that a nigger can aspire to.

970
01:13:36,972 --> 01:13:41,643
Say, one nigger that
just pops up in 10,000.

971
01:13:41,810 --> 01:13:43,312
The exceptional nigger.

972
01:13:44,313 --> 01:13:46,356
Bright day, huh, Bright Boy?

973
01:13:47,483 --> 01:13:48,650
Sun is up.

974
01:13:49,818 --> 01:13:51,695
Shining on all of us.

975
01:13:56,450 --> 01:13:59,369
- [Calvin] Have a seat, doc.
- [Schultz] Thank you.

976
01:13:59,536 --> 01:14:00,829
Quite an honor.

977
01:14:00,996 --> 01:14:02,706
- The honor is all ours.
- Thank you.

978
01:14:02,873 --> 01:14:06,251
<i>[Calvin] But I do believe that,
given time,</i>

979
01:14:06,418 --> 01:14:09,379
exceptional niggers
like Bright Boy here...

980
01:14:10,339 --> 01:14:12,174
...become if not frequent...

981
01:14:13,425 --> 01:14:15,052
...more frequent.

982
01:14:16,804 --> 01:14:21,391
Bright Boy,
you are that one in 10,000.

983
01:14:21,558 --> 01:14:24,436
The name of the game is keep up,
not catch up, nigger.

984
01:14:25,020 --> 01:14:27,106
[men laughing]

985
01:14:37,324 --> 01:14:38,700
- Whoa!
- [whinnying]

986
01:14:40,202 --> 01:14:43,622
- Touch your guns, you die.
- Everybody, calm down!

987
01:14:43,789 --> 01:14:45,707
Now I saw the whole thing.
No harm done.

988
01:14:45,874 --> 01:14:46,917
Are you kidding me?

989
01:14:47,084 --> 01:14:49,086
- This nigger just...
- I said no harm done!

990
01:14:49,253 --> 01:14:51,797
Now take your hand off your pistol!

991
01:14:52,881 --> 01:14:55,676
Butch, that means you too.

992
01:14:56,885 --> 01:14:59,888
Everybody stop antagonizing my guest.

993
01:15:01,390 --> 01:15:03,600
Hoot! Get back up on your horse.

994
01:15:04,351 --> 01:15:05,894
He broke my collarbone!

995
01:15:06,061 --> 01:15:10,357
For God's sake, somebody please help
Hoot here back up on his goddamn horse.

996
01:15:10,524 --> 01:15:13,569
- [man] Yes sir, boss.
- Oh, now you are one lucky nigger.

997
01:15:14,945 --> 01:15:16,321
You better listen to your boss,
white boy.

998
01:15:16,488 --> 01:15:18,949
Oh, I'm gonna go
walking in the moonlight with you.

999
01:15:19,116 --> 01:15:20,909
You wanna hold my hand?

1000
01:15:21,743 --> 01:15:23,370
[chuckling]

1001
01:15:23,537 --> 01:15:25,539
[rap song playing]

1002
01:15:25,706 --> 01:15:27,332
[clucking]

1003
01:15:27,499 --> 01:15:30,169
Willie, take us home.

1004
01:15:32,421 --> 01:15:34,423
[man] Start moving!

1005
01:15:40,804 --> 01:15:42,055
Head 'em out!

1006
01:16:27,684 --> 01:16:29,228
You got a problem
with your eyeball, boy?

1007
01:16:29,394 --> 01:16:30,646
No, sir.

1008
01:16:30,812 --> 01:16:32,314
You want a boot heel in it?

1009
01:16:33,523 --> 01:16:34,483
No, sir.

1010
01:16:34,650 --> 01:16:37,694
Then you keep your
goddamn eyeballs off me.

1011
01:16:37,861 --> 01:16:40,989
You flash that bad look at me again,
I'll give you a reason not to like me.

1012
01:16:41,156 --> 01:16:42,699
Now move, nigger!

1013
01:16:43,242 --> 01:16:44,660
[horse snorting]

1014
01:16:44,826 --> 01:16:46,954
You niggers are gonna
understand something about me.

1015
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:48,997
I'm worse than any of these
white men here.

1016
01:16:49,164 --> 01:16:52,751
You get the molasses out your ass,
you keep your goddamn eyeballs off me.

1017
01:16:52,918 --> 01:16:55,963
He is a rambunctious sort,
ain't he? [chuckles]

1018
01:16:56,129 --> 01:16:57,464
Indeed.

1019
01:16:59,967 --> 01:17:03,345
May we stop for a moment
so I may put a word in my man's ear?

1020
01:17:03,512 --> 01:17:07,224
You know, I'm expecting to fall in love
once I see the specimens at Candyland,

1021
01:17:07,391 --> 01:17:10,477
so before that moment,
it would be good if I could have

1022
01:17:10,644 --> 01:17:15,023
a confidential strategy meeting
with my confidant.

1023
01:17:17,985 --> 01:17:19,820
You mind telling me
what the hell you doing?

1024
01:17:19,987 --> 01:17:22,030
I confirmed that Broomhilda's
at Candyland.

1025
01:17:26,076 --> 01:17:28,662
- You're sure it's her?
- He didn't call her by name,

1026
01:17:28,829 --> 01:17:32,207
but she's a young lady, whip marks
on her back and speaks German.

1027
01:17:32,374 --> 01:17:34,251
Now, while it's not wise to assume,

1028
01:17:34,418 --> 01:17:36,878
in this instance,
I think it's pretty safe.

1029
01:17:37,045 --> 01:17:41,675
Point being, don't get so
carried away with your retribution.

1030
01:17:41,842 --> 01:17:43,802
You lose sight of why we're here.

1031
01:17:43,969 --> 01:17:45,762
- You think I lost sight of that?
- Yes, I do.

1032
01:17:45,929 --> 01:17:48,432
Stop antagonizing Candie.

1033
01:17:48,598 --> 01:17:53,562
You're going to blow this whole charade,
or more than likely get us both killed.

1034
01:17:53,729 --> 01:17:58,400
And I, for one, don't intend to die
in Chickasaw County, Mississippi, USA.

1035
01:17:58,567 --> 01:18:01,570
I'm not antagonizing him.
I'm intriguing him.

1036
01:18:01,737 --> 01:18:04,281
You're yelling abuse
at these poor slaves.

1037
01:18:05,282 --> 01:18:10,704
I recall the man who had me
kill another man in front of his son

1038
01:18:10,871 --> 01:18:12,664
and he didn't bat a eye.

1039
01:18:14,082 --> 01:18:15,208
You remember that?

1040
01:18:17,461 --> 01:18:18,795
Yeah, of course I remember.

1041
01:18:18,962 --> 01:18:22,424
What you said was that
this is my world...

1042
01:18:23,383 --> 01:18:25,385
...and in my world you gotta get dirty.

1043
01:18:26,386 --> 01:18:29,264
So that's what I'm doing.
I'm gettin' dirty.

1044
01:18:32,934 --> 01:18:36,104
Well, you're paraphrasing a tad, but...

1045
01:18:37,564 --> 01:18:39,649
...that was the general gist.

1046
01:18:40,150 --> 01:18:41,318
[sighing]

1047
01:18:43,403 --> 01:18:44,905
See you at Candyland.

1048
01:18:52,621 --> 01:18:55,207
[Django]
All right, niggers, back at it.

1049
01:18:56,500 --> 01:18:58,543
That means you too, Moonlight.

1050
01:19:07,386 --> 01:19:10,013
[dogs barking nearby]

1051
01:19:35,414 --> 01:19:37,332
[dogs barking loudly]

1052
01:19:45,924 --> 01:19:48,802
[Calvin] I'll be. D'Artagnan!

1053
01:19:48,969 --> 01:19:52,222
Now, boy, why do a
fool thing like run off?

1054
01:19:52,389 --> 01:19:54,474
I can't fight no more, Monsieur Candie.

1055
01:19:54,641 --> 01:19:55,934
[Calvin] Yes, you can.

1056
01:19:56,101 --> 01:19:59,646
You might not be able to win,
but your ass can fight.

1057
01:19:59,813 --> 01:20:02,232
Mr. Stonesipher, would you please
shut these goddamn dogs up?

1058
01:20:02,399 --> 01:20:05,026
- I cannot hear myself think!
- Quiet down, Marsha!

1059
01:20:05,193 --> 01:20:07,237
Marsha, hush up! Marsha!

1060
01:20:07,404 --> 01:20:08,947
Hush up! Hey!

1061
01:20:09,114 --> 01:20:11,741
Get these goddamn dogs
away from this nigger!

1062
01:20:11,908 --> 01:20:14,161
[dogs whining]

1063
01:20:21,251 --> 01:20:24,713
Come on now, boy...
get on out that tree.

1064
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:26,548
Yes sir.

1065
01:20:27,090 --> 01:20:28,758
[dogs resume barking]

1066
01:20:33,013 --> 01:20:34,389
[barking stops]

1067
01:20:49,112 --> 01:20:51,239
How long was he loose?

1068
01:20:51,406 --> 01:20:54,659
[speech slurred]
A night. Day.

1069
01:20:54,826 --> 01:20:56,453
Half the other night.

1070
01:20:57,579 --> 01:20:59,122
How far he get off the property?

1071
01:20:59,289 --> 01:21:00,999
'Bout 20 miles off the prop.

1072
01:21:01,166 --> 01:21:03,293
Pretty far considering
that limp he got.

1073
01:21:03,460 --> 01:21:04,836
Hm.

1074
01:21:06,087 --> 01:21:09,424
Mr. Moguy, who was D'Artagnan
supposed to fight on Friday?

1075
01:21:09,591 --> 01:21:11,218
One-a this new lot.

1076
01:21:12,385 --> 01:21:15,096
Well, way he looks now, a blind Indian
wouldn't bet a bead on him.

1077
01:21:15,263 --> 01:21:17,766
[D'Artagnan weeping] Please, Monsieur
Candie, I ain't got it in me no more.

1078
01:21:17,933 --> 01:21:19,434
- Now, now, now, now, now.
- I can't...

1079
01:21:19,601 --> 01:21:22,020
Now, no beggin'.

1080
01:21:22,187 --> 01:21:24,648
No playin' on my soft heart.

1081
01:21:28,109 --> 01:21:30,654
- You in trouble now, son.
- Yes sir.

1082
01:21:33,573 --> 01:21:37,118
I done paid $500 for you.

1083
01:21:37,285 --> 01:21:42,165
When I pay $500, then I expect
to get five fights out of a nigger

1084
01:21:42,332 --> 01:21:44,709
- 'fore he roll over and play dead.
- Sir.

1085
01:21:44,876 --> 01:21:48,755
You got to understand
that I'm runnin' a business here.

1086
01:21:48,922 --> 01:21:51,633
- You fought three fights.
- But I won every one.

1087
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:53,301
Yes, you did. Yes, you did.

1088
01:21:53,468 --> 01:21:56,471
But that last one, you muddled the line
between winnin' and losin'.

1089
01:21:56,638 --> 01:21:57,681
Yes sir.

1090
01:22:00,350 --> 01:22:02,394
Still, the fact remains:

1091
01:22:02,561 --> 01:22:06,189
I pay $500, I want five goddamn fights!

1092
01:22:06,356 --> 01:22:08,900
So what about my $500, huh?

1093
01:22:10,777 --> 01:22:12,696
What about my $500?

1094
01:22:14,239 --> 01:22:15,782
You gonna reimburse me?

1095
01:22:21,788 --> 01:22:24,165
You even know what "reimburse" means?

1096
01:22:24,332 --> 01:22:26,376
- [laughing]
- [Calvin] Huh?

1097
01:22:28,169 --> 01:22:30,672
[laughter continues]

1098
01:22:32,674 --> 01:22:34,384
I'll reimburse you!

1099
01:22:38,138 --> 01:22:39,347
You Will?

1100
01:22:40,557 --> 01:22:42,100
Yep.

1101
01:22:44,853 --> 01:22:47,564
You'll pay $500

1102
01:22:47,731 --> 01:22:51,192
for practically a one-eyed old Joe
ain't fit to push a broom?

1103
01:22:51,359 --> 01:22:52,485
No, he won't.

1104
01:22:54,738 --> 01:22:56,823
He just tired of you
toyin' with him is all.

1105
01:22:57,741 --> 01:22:59,701
Matter of fact, so am I.

1106
01:22:59,868 --> 01:23:02,329
But we ain't payin' a penny
for that pickaninny.

1107
01:23:02,495 --> 01:23:04,289
Ain't got no use for him.
Ain't that right, doc?

1108
01:23:06,041 --> 01:23:07,250
You heard him.

1109
01:23:16,426 --> 01:23:20,180
You're gonna have to excuse
Mr. Stonesipher's slack-jawed gaze.

1110
01:23:20,347 --> 01:23:24,017
He ain't never seen a
nigger like you ever in his life.

1111
01:23:24,809 --> 01:23:26,770
Ain't that right, Mr. Stonesipher?

1112
01:23:29,022 --> 01:23:30,482
That right.

1113
01:23:31,483 --> 01:23:32,817
[Calvin] For that matter...

1114
01:23:34,110 --> 01:23:35,695
...nor have I.

1115
01:23:41,785 --> 01:23:42,952
Now...

1116
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:47,248
...seein' as you won't pay a penny
for this pickaninny here...

1117
01:23:49,751 --> 01:23:53,088
...you won't mind me handlin'
this nigger any way I see fit?

1118
01:23:54,214 --> 01:23:55,757
He's your nigger.

1119
01:23:59,511 --> 01:24:01,596
Mr. Stonesipher?

1120
01:24:02,389 --> 01:24:06,351
Let Marsha and her bitches
send D'Artagnan to nigger heaven.

1121
01:24:06,518 --> 01:24:11,314
- Marsha! Marsha, hey, get him!
- [barks echoing]

1122
01:24:12,774 --> 01:24:14,984
Get 'im, get 'im!

1123
01:24:16,027 --> 01:24:18,530
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

1124
01:24:18,697 --> 01:24:20,115
Whoo-ee!

1125
01:24:25,328 --> 01:24:27,956
- [dogs snarling]
- [screaming]

1126
01:24:48,476 --> 01:24:50,520
Your boss looks a little
green around the gills

1127
01:24:50,687 --> 01:24:52,856
for a blood sport like nigger fighting.

1128
01:24:53,022 --> 01:24:57,652
Nah, he just ain't used to seein'
a man ripped apart by dogs is all.

1129
01:24:58,236 --> 01:24:59,529
Hm.

1130
01:25:00,613 --> 01:25:01,990
You are used to it?

1131
01:25:02,157 --> 01:25:05,118
I'm just a little more
used to Americans than he is.

1132
01:25:05,285 --> 01:25:09,998
- Hm.
- Now, Monsieur Candie...

1133
01:25:10,165 --> 01:25:11,791
...whenever you're ready.

1134
01:25:11,958 --> 01:25:15,336
We rode five hours
so you could show off your stock.

1135
01:25:15,503 --> 01:25:17,130
Let's get to it.

1136
01:25:18,339 --> 01:25:22,719
'Cause as of now,
if he's an example, I ain't impressed.

1137
01:25:24,929 --> 01:25:26,347
Follow me.

1138
01:25:38,818 --> 01:25:40,653
[snarling]

1139
01:25:46,493 --> 01:25:47,911
[clucking]

1140
01:25:48,077 --> 01:25:49,287
[nickering]

1141
01:27:23,631 --> 01:27:26,342
Line 'em up to the left here now, boy.

1142
01:27:27,969 --> 01:27:29,345
Stand up straight, now!

1143
01:27:30,513 --> 01:27:31,806
Get up there.

1144
01:27:31,973 --> 01:27:34,559
Get up there, boy. Come on.

1145
01:27:34,726 --> 01:27:36,352
Give me a line! Give me a line!

1146
01:27:36,519 --> 01:27:38,605
Get in line there! Straighten up!

1147
01:28:36,329 --> 01:28:37,538
[indistinct chatter]

1148
01:28:38,247 --> 01:28:39,874
Hello! Stephen, my boy!

1149
01:28:40,041 --> 01:28:42,710
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hello, my ass.

1150
01:28:42,877 --> 01:28:45,838
Who this nigger up on that nag?

1151
01:28:46,005 --> 01:28:49,342
Stephen, you have nails for breakfast?
What's-a matter? Why you so ornery?

1152
01:28:49,509 --> 01:28:51,886
- You miss me, huh?
- Oh, yes sir. [laughs]

1153
01:28:52,053 --> 01:28:55,598
I miss you like a hog miss slop!

1154
01:28:55,765 --> 01:28:59,686
- Like a baby miss mammy's titty.
- [all chuckling]

1155
01:28:59,852 --> 01:29:03,690
I miss you like I misses
a rock in my shoe.

1156
01:29:03,856 --> 01:29:05,942
[laughing]

1157
01:29:06,109 --> 01:29:10,571
Now, I axed you:
Who this nigger on that nag?

1158
01:29:10,738 --> 01:29:12,407
Hey, Snowball?

1159
01:29:13,616 --> 01:29:17,203
Wanna know my name or
the name of my horse, you ask me.

1160
01:29:17,370 --> 01:29:20,206
Just who the hell you callin'
"Snowball," horse boy?

1161
01:29:20,373 --> 01:29:22,041
I'll snatch your
black ass off that nag there

1162
01:29:22,208 --> 01:29:23,584
- and in the mud so fast...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1163
01:29:23,751 --> 01:29:25,837
- ...make your head spin.
- Stephen, Stephen, Stephen.

1164
01:29:26,004 --> 01:29:30,299
Let's keep it funny.
Django here's a free man.

1165
01:29:30,466 --> 01:29:32,844
- This nigger here?
- That nigger there.

1166
01:29:33,011 --> 01:29:35,263
Let me at least
introduce the two of you.

1167
01:29:35,430 --> 01:29:39,225
Django, this is another cheeky
black bugger like yourself, Stephen.

1168
01:29:39,392 --> 01:29:42,645
Stephen, this here's Django.
You two oughta hate each other.

1169
01:29:42,812 --> 01:29:46,816
Calvin, just who the hell is this nigger
you feels the need to entertain?

1170
01:29:46,983 --> 01:29:50,903
Django and his friend in gray here,
Dr. Schultz, are customers.

1171
01:29:51,070 --> 01:29:52,447
And they are our guests, Stephen.

1172
01:29:52,613 --> 01:29:56,117
And you, you old decrepit bastard,
oughta show them every hospitality.

1173
01:29:56,284 --> 01:29:58,661
- You understand that?
- Yes sir. Him I understand.

1174
01:29:58,828 --> 01:30:00,496
But I don't know why
I got to take lip off this nigger.

1175
01:30:00,663 --> 01:30:03,291
You don't have to know why.
Do you understand?

1176
01:30:04,292 --> 01:30:05,793
Yes sir. I understand.

1177
01:30:05,960 --> 01:30:08,421
Well,good.
They're spendin' the night.

1178
01:30:08,588 --> 01:30:10,715
Go up in the guest bedrooms
and get two ready.

1179
01:30:11,883 --> 01:30:13,551
He gonna stay in The Big House?

1180
01:30:13,718 --> 01:30:15,928
Stephen, he's a slaver.
It's different.

1181
01:30:16,095 --> 01:30:18,681
- In The Big House?
- Well, you got a problem with that?

1182
01:30:18,848 --> 01:30:21,142
Oh, no.
I ain't got no problem with it,

1183
01:30:21,309 --> 01:30:23,352
if you ain't got no problem
with burnin' the bed, the sheets,

1184
01:30:23,519 --> 01:30:25,855
the pillowcases, everything else when
this black-ass motherfucker's gone!

1185
01:30:26,022 --> 01:30:28,274
That is my problem!
They are mine to burn!

1186
01:30:28,441 --> 01:30:30,651
Now your problem right now
is makin' a good impression!

1187
01:30:30,818 --> 01:30:32,737
And I want you to start solvin'
that problem right now

1188
01:30:32,904 --> 01:30:34,530
and get them goddamn rooms ready!

1189
01:30:36,657 --> 01:30:38,576
Yes sir, Monsieur Candie.

1190
01:30:40,036 --> 01:30:41,204
Go on, now.

1191
01:30:42,121 --> 01:30:44,540
Can't believe you brought
a nigger to stay in The Big House.

1192
01:30:44,707 --> 01:30:46,042
Your daddy rollin' over
in his goddamned grave.

1193
01:30:46,209 --> 01:30:49,754
Man, the lip on him. Whoo!
He's gettin' worse and worse.

1194
01:30:49,921 --> 01:30:51,089
Now...

1195
01:30:51,255 --> 01:30:55,927
Where is my beautiful sister?!

1196
01:30:56,094 --> 01:30:59,180
There she is!
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

1197
01:30:59,347 --> 01:31:04,393
Dr. Schultz, this attractive
Southern belle is my widowed sister.

1198
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:08,564
Darlin', you are a tonic for tired eyes.

1199
01:31:09,816 --> 01:31:13,194
May I present to you
Lara Lee Candie-Fitzwilly.

1200
01:31:13,361 --> 01:31:16,739
Chester, Rodney, Chicken Charly.
Y'all get your ass over by that pen.

1201
01:31:16,906 --> 01:31:19,033
- Come on, Charly. Come on, now!
- Let's go.

1202
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:20,243
You know where it is.

1203
01:31:20,409 --> 01:31:22,161
Like you on a rope!

1204
01:31:23,371 --> 01:31:26,124
Niggers don't walk around here,
niggers run!

1205
01:31:26,833 --> 01:31:29,836
- Monsieur Candie?
- Hm?

1206
01:31:30,002 --> 01:31:33,798
Yeah. About that matter about the
nigger girl you were talking about?

1207
01:31:33,965 --> 01:31:34,924
Nigger gal?

1208
01:31:35,091 --> 01:31:38,094
Yeah, I believe you mentioned
she spoke German.

1209
01:31:38,261 --> 01:31:40,847
Ah, yes! Hildi, what about her?

1210
01:31:41,013 --> 01:31:45,184
Do you think before the demonstration,
you could send her around to my room?

1211
01:31:45,351 --> 01:31:49,522
[laughs] You little dickens, you.
I don't see why not.

1212
01:31:49,689 --> 01:31:53,067
Stephen, when you get through showin'
them to their rooms, go fetch Hildi,

1213
01:31:53,234 --> 01:31:55,069
get her cleaned up
and smellin' real nice,

1214
01:31:55,236 --> 01:31:56,654
and sent over to
Dr. Schultz's room here.

1215
01:31:56,821 --> 01:31:58,489
Actually, Monsieur Candie, sir,

1216
01:31:58,656 --> 01:32:01,325
there's-a somethin'
I ain't told you 'bout yet.

1217
01:32:01,534 --> 01:32:05,204
- What?
- [stammers] Uh, Hildi in the Hot Box.

1218
01:32:06,706 --> 01:32:07,874
[Calvin] What's she doin' there?

1219
01:32:08,040 --> 01:32:10,793
[Stephen] What you think she
doin' there in the Hot Box?

1220
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:12,420
She bein' punished.

1221
01:32:12,587 --> 01:32:14,922
- [Calvin] What she do?
- [Stephen] She run off again.

1222
01:32:15,089 --> 01:32:17,758
Jesus Christ, Stephen, how many people
ran away while I was gone?

1223
01:32:17,925 --> 01:32:20,428
- Two.
- When did she go?

1224
01:32:20,595 --> 01:32:23,097
Last night.
They brung her back this morning.

1225
01:32:23,264 --> 01:32:25,933
How bad did Stonesipher's dogs
tear her up?

1226
01:32:26,851 --> 01:32:30,354
[Stephen] Lucky for her,
they was out chasin' D'Artagnan's ass.

1227
01:32:30,521 --> 01:32:34,817
Bill and Cody went lookin' for her,
found her, brung her back.

1228
01:32:34,984 --> 01:32:37,904
Now, she a little beat-up.
But she done that to her own damn self

1229
01:32:38,070 --> 01:32:39,280
runnin' through them
damn bushes and shit.

1230
01:32:39,447 --> 01:32:41,115
[Calvin]
How long she been in the box?

1231
01:32:41,282 --> 01:32:44,076
[Stephen] How long you think
she been in there? All damn day.

1232
01:32:44,243 --> 01:32:46,913
And the little bitch
got ten more days to be in there.

1233
01:32:47,079 --> 01:32:50,124
- Still, take her out.
- Take her out? Why?

1234
01:32:50,291 --> 01:32:54,212
Because I said so, that's why.
Dr. Schultz is my guest.

1235
01:32:54,378 --> 01:32:55,338
Hildi is my nigger.

1236
01:32:55,504 --> 01:32:58,674
Southern hospitality dictates
I make her available to him.

1237
01:32:58,841 --> 01:33:02,053
- But, Monsieur Candie, she run off.
- Jesus Christ, Stephen.

1238
01:33:02,220 --> 01:33:04,639
What is the point of havin'
a nigger that speaks German

1239
01:33:04,805 --> 01:33:07,266
if you can't wheel 'em out
when you have a German guest?

1240
01:33:07,433 --> 01:33:11,604
Now, I realize it is inconvenient,
but still, you take her ass out.

1241
01:33:11,771 --> 01:33:12,939
Yes sir.

1242
01:33:14,232 --> 01:33:16,817
[Calvin] Lara Lee!
Will you and Cora be responsible

1243
01:33:16,984 --> 01:33:20,363
for gettin' Hildi cleaned up
and presentable for Dr. Schultz here.

1244
01:33:20,529 --> 01:33:21,906
[Lara Lee] Of course, darlin'.

1245
01:33:22,073 --> 01:33:26,953
Now, gentlemen, I do apologize, but I am
weary from our travels beyond words.

1246
01:33:27,119 --> 01:33:29,997
It is time for me to rest my tired eyes.

1247
01:33:32,458 --> 01:33:34,669
[clucking]

1248
01:33:34,835 --> 01:33:37,588
Y'all done heard the man!
Get her ass up outta there!

1249
01:33:37,755 --> 01:33:40,299
Cora! Come here!

1250
01:33:40,466 --> 01:33:43,511
Get over there and get her cleaned up,
bring her back over here to Dr...

1251
01:33:43,678 --> 01:33:46,055
- What he say your name is? Shoots?
- Schultz.

1252
01:33:46,222 --> 01:33:48,683
Schultz. Get her back over here.
Hurry up, girl.

1253
01:33:48,849 --> 01:33:52,228
- Yes sir.
- [soft guitar music plays]

1254
01:34:33,102 --> 01:34:34,979
[Hildi screams]

1255
01:34:35,813 --> 01:34:38,524
Come on, girl. Stand up.

1256
01:34:39,734 --> 01:34:41,110
[Hildi yelling]

1257
01:34:41,277 --> 01:34:44,822
[gasping screaming]

1258
01:34:46,115 --> 01:34:48,576
[sobbing]

1259
01:35:08,554 --> 01:35:12,099
Is you comin' with me or is you gonna
sleep in that little box over yonder?

1260
01:35:14,810 --> 01:35:17,480
[slow-tempo song plays]

1261
01:35:21,025 --> 01:35:23,652
[woman sings in foreign language]

1262
01:36:39,353 --> 01:36:40,521
[exhales]

1263
01:36:47,278 --> 01:36:48,737
Hello, ladies.

1264
01:36:48,904 --> 01:36:52,283
Dr. Schultz.
May I introduce to you Broomhilda?

1265
01:36:56,454 --> 01:36:58,914
Hildi, this is Dr. Schultz.

1266
01:37:00,374 --> 01:37:02,501
It's a pleasure to meet you, Broomhilda.

1267
01:37:03,544 --> 01:37:05,880
I've heard a lot of
good things about you.

1268
01:37:06,046 --> 01:37:08,841
Well, it's not every nigger
speaks German, don't ya know.

1269
01:37:09,008 --> 01:37:10,926
- [chuckles]
- [forced chuckle]

1270
01:37:12,094 --> 01:37:14,096
As I look at you now, Broomhilda,

1271
01:37:14,263 --> 01:37:19,226
I can see all the passions you inspire
are completely justified.

1272
01:37:22,563 --> 01:37:24,899
The doctor here speaks German.

1273
01:37:26,901 --> 01:37:28,861
And I've been informed you do as well?

1274
01:37:30,404 --> 01:37:32,573
Go ahead, girl.
Speak a little German.

1275
01:37:34,700 --> 01:37:38,329
[Speaking German]

1276
01:37:39,121 --> 01:37:40,748
Ha! [laughs]

1277
01:37:40,915 --> 01:37:42,917
Astonishing.

1278
01:37:43,083 --> 01:37:44,752
[Speaking German]

1279
01:37:49,882 --> 01:37:52,092
- And I shall bring you...
- [Schultz] Much obliged.

1280
01:38:01,602 --> 01:38:02,728
<i>Ja.</i>

1281
01:38:23,374 --> 01:38:24,959
[speaks German]

1282
01:38:26,126 --> 01:38:27,586
Don't be afraid.

1283
01:39:05,666 --> 01:39:08,168
Hm. Pardon.

1284
01:39:15,759 --> 01:39:17,052
<i>Danke.</i>

1285
01:40:00,888 --> 01:40:02,514
[chuckling]

1286
01:40:45,307 --> 01:40:47,351
[repeats German phrase]

1287
01:41:02,491 --> 01:41:04,076
Hey, Little Trouble Maker.

1288
01:41:04,660 --> 01:41:06,245
[gasping]

1289
01:41:08,664 --> 01:41:09,832
[moaning]

1290
01:41:12,668 --> 01:41:15,963
You silver-tongued devil, you.

1291
01:41:17,548 --> 01:41:18,882
- Hurry up, girl.
- These ready, Miss Cora.

1292
01:41:19,049 --> 01:41:20,300
No, no, no, they drinkin' tonight.

1293
01:41:20,467 --> 01:41:23,429
Go downstairs, get the big jug with the
red stuff Monsieur Candie like, hear?

1294
01:41:23,595 --> 01:41:26,348
- Get your big pretty ass out the way.
- You know you like it.

1295
01:41:26,515 --> 01:41:28,726
[laughs] That's 'cause
you knows what I like.

1296
01:41:28,892 --> 01:41:31,478
Ooh!
Come on with these biscuits, girl.

1297
01:41:31,645 --> 01:41:37,443
Look, Monsieur Candie, they were
all fine specimens, no doubt about it.

1298
01:41:37,609 --> 01:41:41,989
But the best three by far were Samson...

1299
01:41:43,365 --> 01:41:44,950
- What's that other one's name?
- Goldie.

1300
01:41:45,117 --> 01:41:48,454
Goldie. And Eskimo Joe.

1301
01:41:48,620 --> 01:41:51,206
By the way, why is he called Eskimo Joe?

1302
01:41:51,373 --> 01:41:54,460
[chuckles] You never know how
these nigger nicknames get started.

1303
01:41:54,626 --> 01:41:57,212
His name was Joe, maybe one day
he said he was cold. Who knows?

1304
01:41:57,379 --> 01:41:59,381
[all laugh]

1305
01:42:00,883 --> 01:42:06,221
Well, regardless, Samson's your best.
We all know that.

1306
01:42:06,388 --> 01:42:10,100
You will never sell him,
and I can see why. He's a champion.

1307
01:42:10,267 --> 01:42:14,021
Hm-hm.
All three are champions.

1308
01:42:14,688 --> 01:42:16,774
Samson's the champion.

1309
01:42:16,940 --> 01:42:18,734
Them other two pretty good.

1310
01:42:20,027 --> 01:42:21,528
Calvin, now what's
this nigger you let...

1311
01:42:21,695 --> 01:42:22,821
It's all right.

1312
01:42:22,988 --> 01:42:25,073
You have to understand,
Monsieur Candie,

1313
01:42:25,240 --> 01:42:28,619
while admittedly a neophyte
in the nigger fight game,

1314
01:42:28,786 --> 01:42:33,081
I do have a little bit of a background
in the European traveling circus.

1315
01:42:33,248 --> 01:42:34,333
Is that right?

1316
01:42:34,500 --> 01:42:38,587
Hence, I have big ideas
when it comes to presentation.

1317
01:42:38,754 --> 01:42:39,713
Hm.

1318
01:42:39,880 --> 01:42:42,341
I need something more
than just a big nigger.

1319
01:42:44,092 --> 01:42:46,303
Yeah, he needs to have panache.

1320
01:42:46,470 --> 01:42:49,556
- Need to have what? What?
- Panache. Uh...

1321
01:42:49,723 --> 01:42:52,476
- A sense of Showmanship.
- Showmanship, yes.

1322
01:42:52,643 --> 01:42:55,854
I want to be able to bill him
as The Black Hercules.

1323
01:42:56,021 --> 01:42:57,648
[all chuckling]

1324
01:42:57,815 --> 01:42:59,191
The Black Hercules,
isn't that clever?

1325
01:42:59,358 --> 01:43:00,359
More like Nigger-les.

1326
01:43:00,526 --> 01:43:02,653
[laughing]

1327
01:43:02,820 --> 01:43:08,200
I said, and I quote:
"I would pay top dollar for...

1328
01:43:08,700 --> 01:43:11,495
...'the right nigger."'

1329
01:43:11,662 --> 01:43:15,958
Now I'm not saying that Eskimo Joe
is the wrong nigger, per se.

1330
01:43:16,124 --> 01:43:18,836
But is he right as rain?

1331
01:43:20,087 --> 01:43:21,505
Oh, Dr. Schultz,

1332
01:43:21,672 --> 01:43:25,467
I will have you know there
is no one in the nigger fight game

1333
01:43:25,634 --> 01:43:27,553
that appreciates
the value of showmanship

1334
01:43:27,719 --> 01:43:29,471
more than Monsieur
Calvin J. Candie here.

1335
01:43:29,638 --> 01:43:30,639
Nobody.

1336
01:43:30,806 --> 01:43:32,641
But one must not forget
the most important thing

1337
01:43:32,808 --> 01:43:34,184
- in the nigger fight game.
- Hm-mm.

1338
01:43:34,351 --> 01:43:36,353
And that is a nigger
that can win fights.

1339
01:43:36,520 --> 01:43:37,729
Hm-mm.

1340
01:43:37,896 --> 01:43:42,109
Now that should be your first, second,
third, fourth, and fifth concern.

1341
01:43:42,276 --> 01:43:44,319
Now, after you have that,
and you know you have that,

1342
01:43:44,486 --> 01:43:48,448
then you can start
to implement a grand design.

1343
01:43:48,615 --> 01:43:51,159
In other words, first thing is first.

1344
01:43:51,326 --> 01:43:52,786
First thing's first.

1345
01:43:57,624 --> 01:43:59,251
[whispers in German]

1346
01:44:00,460 --> 01:44:03,839
Ooh! I see you two gettin' on.

1347
01:44:04,006 --> 01:44:05,883
Famously.

1348
01:44:06,633 --> 01:44:09,303
Oh, Monsieur Candie,
you can't imagine what it's like

1349
01:44:09,469 --> 01:44:12,806
not to hear your
native tongue in four years.

1350
01:44:12,973 --> 01:44:14,808
Well, hell,
I can't imagine two weeks in Boston.

1351
01:44:14,975 --> 01:44:17,060
[laughing]

1352
01:44:17,227 --> 01:44:19,271
Two weeks in Boston!

1353
01:44:19,438 --> 01:44:22,232
- Monsieur Candie, you a mess!
- [coughing]

1354
01:44:22,399 --> 01:44:24,109
[Stephen] Two weeks in Boston!

1355
01:44:24,276 --> 01:44:29,489
I can't express the joy I felt
conversing in my mother tongue.

1356
01:44:29,656 --> 01:44:33,744
And Hildi is a charming
conversation companion.

1357
01:44:33,911 --> 01:44:35,787
[Calvin] Well, be careful now,
Dr. Schultz.

1358
01:44:35,954 --> 01:44:37,289
You might-a caught yourself

1359
01:44:37,456 --> 01:44:38,707
- a little dose of nigger love.
- Hm!

1360
01:44:38,874 --> 01:44:40,959
[Calvin] Nigger love's
a powerful emotion, boy.

1361
01:44:41,126 --> 01:44:43,128
- [Stephen] Hm!
- It's like a pool of black tar.

1362
01:44:43,295 --> 01:44:44,922
Once it catches your ass, you're caught.

1363
01:44:45,088 --> 01:44:48,050
Yessir, you stuck. [laughs]

1364
01:44:48,216 --> 01:44:49,760
[Lara Lee] I don't know, doctor.

1365
01:44:49,927 --> 01:44:52,179
You can lay on all the
German sweet talk you want,

1366
01:44:52,346 --> 01:44:56,850
but it looks like this pony's
got big eyes for Django.

1367
01:44:57,976 --> 01:44:59,102
[Lara Lee giggles]

1368
01:44:59,269 --> 01:45:01,730
Well, naturally.

1369
01:45:01,897 --> 01:45:05,525
It is the soaring eagle
that attracts her attention,

1370
01:45:05,692 --> 01:45:08,487
- not the plucked chicken.
- [all chuckle]

1371
01:45:08,654 --> 01:45:11,156
[Calvin] Dr. Schultz, don't be
so down on yourself.

1372
01:45:11,323 --> 01:45:13,241
You are quite the dapper
European gentleman.

1373
01:45:13,408 --> 01:45:14,451
[Cora] You got to clean these dishes,

1374
01:45:14,618 --> 01:45:16,620
you got to put your elbow
in these dishes, you hear me?

1375
01:45:16,787 --> 01:45:18,997
You know that nigger, don't you?

1376
01:45:19,915 --> 01:45:21,208
- Who?
- "Who?"

1377
01:45:21,375 --> 01:45:24,461
Don't "who" me, bitch.
You know who I'm talkin' about.

1378
01:45:26,213 --> 01:45:28,215
At the table?

1379
01:45:28,382 --> 01:45:29,633
I don't know him.

1380
01:45:29,800 --> 01:45:32,844
- You don't know him.
- No.

1381
01:45:33,011 --> 01:45:35,847
- "No," what?
- No, sir.

1382
01:45:37,933 --> 01:45:39,017
[chuckles]

1383
01:45:40,477 --> 01:45:42,938
You wouldn't lie to me, now, would you?

1384
01:45:47,150 --> 01:45:48,360
OK.

1385
01:45:49,611 --> 01:45:52,739
Yeah. If you say so.

1386
01:45:59,204 --> 01:46:02,624
Eskimo Joe's a quality nigger,
no doubt about it.

1387
01:46:04,001 --> 01:46:09,172
But if it was my money,
I wouldn't pay no $12,000 for him.

1388
01:46:09,339 --> 01:46:11,675
What would your price be?

1389
01:46:11,842 --> 01:46:13,802
Well, if I was inclined
to be generous...

1390
01:46:13,969 --> 01:46:17,431
...and I don't know why
I would be inclined to be generous...

1391
01:46:18,390 --> 01:46:21,643
...9,000. Maybe.

1392
01:46:22,894 --> 01:46:28,692
Dr. Schultz, let me reclarify how
this whole negotiation came about.

1393
01:46:28,859 --> 01:46:31,028
You see, it wasn't me
who came to you to sell a nigger.

1394
01:46:31,194 --> 01:46:32,154
Sure wasn't.

1395
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:34,031
It was you who approached me to buy one.

1396
01:46:34,197 --> 01:46:36,366
- Sure was.
- Now, that $9,000 figure

1397
01:46:36,533 --> 01:46:38,952
Bright Boy's been bandyin' about,
that ain't too far off from right.

1398
01:46:39,119 --> 01:46:40,746
And if I wanted to sell
Eskimo Joe for that,

1399
01:46:40,912 --> 01:46:43,874
- I could do so any day of the week.
- Any day.

1400
01:46:44,041 --> 01:46:48,295
But, like you said in Greenville,
doctor... I don't want to sell him.

1401
01:46:48,920 --> 01:46:52,924
It was only your ridiculous
offer of $12,000

1402
01:46:53,091 --> 01:46:55,927
- that made me even consider it.
- Hm-mm.

1403
01:47:00,599 --> 01:47:03,935
[deep inhale]

1404
01:47:04,102 --> 01:47:08,190
You know, Monsieur Candie,
you do possess the power of persuasion.

1405
01:47:08,356 --> 01:47:09,649
[chuckles]

1406
01:47:12,110 --> 01:47:14,529
[slamming table] Why not?
Monsieur Candie, you have a deal.

1407
01:47:14,696 --> 01:47:18,033
- Eskimo Joe, $12,000.
- [banging table] Hooray, doctor.

1408
01:47:18,200 --> 01:47:20,327
Hooray.
And a wise decision that is.

1409
01:47:20,494 --> 01:47:24,039
However, that is
a tremendous amount of money.

1410
01:47:24,206 --> 01:47:27,375
And the way you have
your Mr. Moguy, I have a lawyer.

1411
01:47:27,542 --> 01:47:29,336
Persnickety man named Tuttle.

1412
01:47:29,503 --> 01:47:32,589
And I would need my Mr. Tuttle
to draw up a legal contract

1413
01:47:32,756 --> 01:47:35,801
before I'd feel comfortable exchanging
that amount of money for flesh.

1414
01:47:35,967 --> 01:47:36,968
Hm-mm.

1415
01:47:37,135 --> 01:47:38,804
Not to mention having
Eskimo Joe examined

1416
01:47:38,970 --> 01:47:41,598
- by a physician of my choosing.
- [Calvin] Naturally.

1417
01:47:41,765 --> 01:47:46,478
So, say I return in about...

1418
01:47:48,647 --> 01:47:50,941
- ...five days time.
- Five days?

1419
01:47:51,108 --> 01:47:52,359
With my Mr. Tuttle.

1420
01:47:52,526 --> 01:47:54,569
And then my Mr. Tuttle
and your Mr. Moguy

1421
01:47:54,736 --> 01:47:57,697
can hash out the finer
details between themselves.

1422
01:47:58,532 --> 01:48:01,576
I say splendid, doctor. Splendid.

1423
01:48:02,327 --> 01:48:03,495
Gentlemen...

1424
01:48:04,496 --> 01:48:06,498
...may I propose a toast.

1425
01:48:08,875 --> 01:48:13,755
To Eskimo Joe.
Or shall we call him The Black Hercules?

1426
01:48:13,922 --> 01:48:16,591
- [all chuckling]
- To The Black Hercules.

1427
01:48:16,758 --> 01:48:18,135
[Stephen] The Black Hercules.

1428
01:48:18,301 --> 01:48:19,719
[speaks low]
To The Black Hercules.

1429
01:48:19,886 --> 01:48:23,723
You was right, doctor.
That name do have pan-ass. [chuckles]

1430
01:48:23,890 --> 01:48:25,308
Hm.

1431
01:48:25,475 --> 01:48:28,728
Hildi, top my drink off.

1432
01:48:31,815 --> 01:48:36,862
So, Hildi, how you like servin'
at the big table in The Big House, huh?

1433
01:48:37,028 --> 01:48:40,240
When Monsieur Candie talk to you,
you answers.

1434
01:48:40,407 --> 01:48:43,160
- I like it a lot, Monsieur Candie.
- Hm-mm.

1435
01:48:43,326 --> 01:48:46,079
It's a lot better than sizzlin'
in that Hot Box or draggin' your ass

1436
01:48:46,246 --> 01:48:47,581
through a bramble bush.

1437
01:48:47,747 --> 01:48:50,834
But maybe it's not quite as much fun as
gettin' to pleasure all them Mandingos,

1438
01:48:51,001 --> 01:48:52,586
- huh, sugar bear?
- Oh, Lord, she like them niggers.

1439
01:48:52,752 --> 01:48:53,920
- Sure do.
- Like Samson? Huh?

1440
01:48:54,087 --> 01:48:55,547
[Hildi] No, sir.

1441
01:48:55,714 --> 01:48:57,048
You know, Monsieur Candie,

1442
01:48:57,215 --> 01:49:00,886
the doctor here might be interested
in seein' Hildi's peeled back,

1443
01:49:01,052 --> 01:49:04,306
seein' as how they don't have
many niggers where he come from.

1444
01:49:04,472 --> 01:49:06,600
Dr. Schultz,
when you was alone with Hildi, here,

1445
01:49:06,766 --> 01:49:09,811
did you just speak German
or did you get to take her clothes off?

1446
01:49:09,978 --> 01:49:11,730
No, we just talked and...

1447
01:49:11,897 --> 01:49:14,274
[Calvin] Oh, so you
haven't seen her back?

1448
01:49:14,441 --> 01:49:16,234
- I haven't...
- No, no, no, no.

1449
01:49:16,401 --> 01:49:18,445
Stephen's right,
you might find this interesting.

1450
01:49:18,612 --> 01:49:21,698
Hildi, go on, take off your dress.
Show Dr. Schultz your back here.

1451
01:49:21,865 --> 01:49:23,825
- Go on.
- [Lara Lee] Uh, Calvin.

1452
01:49:23,992 --> 01:49:26,369
I just got her all dressed up
and lookin' nice.

1453
01:49:26,536 --> 01:49:29,456
[Calvin] But, Lara Lee,
Dr. Schultz is from Dusseldorf.

1454
01:49:29,623 --> 01:49:32,626
They don't got niggers there.
He is a man of medicine.

1455
01:49:32,792 --> 01:49:35,378
I'm sure it would fascinate him,
the niggers' endurance for pain.

1456
01:49:35,545 --> 01:49:39,132
These niggers are tough,
Dr. Schultz, no doubt about it.

1457
01:49:39,299 --> 01:49:41,468
Hildi's got somethin'
like four lashes on her back.

1458
01:49:41,635 --> 01:49:43,553
Lara Lee just get one,
she'd lose her goddamn mind.

1459
01:49:43,762 --> 01:49:44,846
- [Stephen] Sure would.
- [Calvin] Look at that, doctor.

1460
01:49:45,013 --> 01:49:47,265
- It's like a paintin'. Look at that.
- Calvin!

1461
01:49:48,058 --> 01:49:51,102
We are eating. Ain't no one wanna
look at her whipped up back.

1462
01:49:52,771 --> 01:49:55,190
- [exhales]
- Fine. Fine, fine, fine, fine.

1463
01:49:55,357 --> 01:49:58,026
After dinner, then, Stephen.
After dinner.

1464
01:49:59,236 --> 01:50:01,029
During the brandies, gentlemen, hm?

1465
01:50:07,410 --> 01:50:08,954
[Lara Lee]
Cora, come get this girl!

1466
01:50:09,120 --> 01:50:10,789
[approaching footsteps]

1467
01:50:12,415 --> 01:50:15,627
- [Lara Lee] She a mess.
- Yes, ma'am. [gasps] Oh!

1468
01:50:15,794 --> 01:50:18,255
Why are you all undone?
I just got you done up.

1469
01:50:18,421 --> 01:50:19,756
Come on in here.

1470
01:50:26,263 --> 01:50:30,058
Baby, you on Stephen bad side,
and you need to be on his blind side.

1471
01:50:30,225 --> 01:50:32,185
You say you ain't know him.

1472
01:50:33,311 --> 01:50:34,396
Huh?

1473
01:50:34,562 --> 01:50:40,151
I said, you said you ain't know him.

1474
01:50:41,319 --> 01:50:44,698
- I don't.
- Yes, you do.

1475
01:50:46,866 --> 01:50:48,493
Mr. Stephen...

1476
01:50:49,494 --> 01:50:50,495
...I don't.

1477
01:50:50,662 --> 01:50:53,164
Why is you lying to me?

1478
01:50:55,542 --> 01:50:56,876
I ain't.

1479
01:50:57,043 --> 01:50:59,546
Then why is you crying?

1480
01:50:59,713 --> 01:51:01,881
You scarin' me.

1481
01:51:02,048 --> 01:51:05,969
- Why is I'm scaring you?
- Because you scary.

1482
01:51:07,637 --> 01:51:10,724
[Schultz] To speak German
this afternoon with Hildi

1483
01:51:10,890 --> 01:51:14,019
was positively soul-enriching.

1484
01:51:14,185 --> 01:51:17,063
[Calvin] Doctor,
that warms my heart to hear that.

1485
01:51:17,230 --> 01:51:20,066
You stay right here.

1486
01:51:25,405 --> 01:51:29,909
[Schultz] You indicated earlier
you'd be willing to part with Hildi.

1487
01:51:30,076 --> 01:51:32,912
Why,yes.
Yessiree bob, I did.

1488
01:51:34,914 --> 01:51:40,879
In that case, allow me
to propose another proposition.

1489
01:51:41,046 --> 01:51:42,422
I'm all ears.

1490
01:51:42,589 --> 01:51:44,299
Hurry up, goddamn it!

1491
01:51:44,924 --> 01:51:46,509
- Monsieur Candie...
- [Calvin] Stephen!

1492
01:51:47,552 --> 01:51:50,013
You just interrupted Dr. Schultz here.

1493
01:51:51,139 --> 01:51:53,266
[Stephen] I'm sorry, Dr. Schultz.

1494
01:51:53,433 --> 01:51:56,144
My ears ain't worth a damn these days.

1495
01:51:56,311 --> 01:51:57,437
Excuse him.

1496
01:51:57,604 --> 01:52:01,358
Monsieur Candie, could I get
a word with you in the kitchen?

1497
01:52:01,524 --> 01:52:03,443
You mean get up out of my chair?

1498
01:52:03,610 --> 01:52:06,946
- If'n you could manage it.
- Why?

1499
01:52:07,113 --> 01:52:10,950
- It's about dessert.
- What about dessert?

1500
01:52:11,117 --> 01:52:13,745
I'd rather discuss that in private.

1501
01:52:13,912 --> 01:52:15,789
We're having white cake!

1502
01:52:15,955 --> 01:52:18,291
What sort of melodrama
could be brewing back there?

1503
01:52:18,458 --> 01:52:22,796
You right, Monsieur Candie.
You right. I'll handle it myself.

1504
01:52:22,962 --> 01:52:24,756
[whispers] Meet me in the library.

1505
01:52:24,923 --> 01:52:28,009
I just can't understand why you
won't come talk to these niggers.

1506
01:52:28,176 --> 01:52:30,053
Shit get fucked up around here,
you blame me.

1507
01:52:30,220 --> 01:52:35,225
Fine! Fine. Friend Stephen,
I will be along momentarily.

1508
01:52:35,392 --> 01:52:36,559
Yes sir.

1509
01:52:37,477 --> 01:52:41,147
Well, gentlemen, as you can see,

1510
01:52:41,314 --> 01:52:43,066
talented as they are,
no doubt, in the kitchen,

1511
01:52:43,233 --> 01:52:46,861
from time to time,
adult supervision is required.

1512
01:52:47,028 --> 01:52:48,321
[all chuckle]

1513
01:52:49,864 --> 01:52:51,658
If you'll excuse me a moment.

1514
01:52:57,831 --> 01:52:59,624
[Calvin] You may clear
the dinner service.

1515
01:53:01,084 --> 01:53:04,462
[Cora] You heard him. Go on!
Get! Hurry up, girl.

1516
01:53:04,629 --> 01:53:10,051
So, Dr. Schultz, why don't you
regale us with a tale of the circus.

1517
01:53:10,218 --> 01:53:12,887
[chuckles] The circus?

1518
01:53:13,054 --> 01:53:14,556
[fire crackling]

1519
01:53:19,352 --> 01:53:21,146
What is the matter?

1520
01:53:26,401 --> 01:53:31,489
Them motherfuckers
ain't here to buy no Mandingos.

1521
01:53:31,656 --> 01:53:35,201
- They wants that girl.
- [chuckling]

1522
01:53:35,368 --> 01:53:38,121
Stephen, what the hell
are you talking about? Hm?

1523
01:53:38,288 --> 01:53:41,458
They playing your ass for a fool
is what I'm talking about.

1524
01:53:41,624 --> 01:53:45,295
They ain't here for
no musclebound Jimmie.

1525
01:53:45,462 --> 01:53:47,630
They here for that girl.

1526
01:53:47,797 --> 01:53:50,425
Wh... What girl? Hildi?

1527
01:53:50,592 --> 01:53:54,220
Yeah, Hildi. Her and Django,
them niggers know each other.

1528
01:53:55,930 --> 01:53:57,515
He just bought Eskimo Joe.

1529
01:53:57,682 --> 01:54:00,059
- Did he give you any money?
- No! Not yet. But...

1530
01:54:00,226 --> 01:54:02,687
Then he ain't bought diddly.
Not yet, nohow.

1531
01:54:02,854 --> 01:54:05,106
But he's just about to buy

1532
01:54:05,273 --> 01:54:08,485
who he come here to buy
when I interrupted him.

1533
01:54:08,651 --> 01:54:11,654
"Thank you, Stephen."
You're welcome, Calvin.

1534
01:54:17,076 --> 01:54:19,078
Where you gettin' all this?

1535
01:54:20,205 --> 01:54:21,998
Why would they go through
all that trouble for a nigger

1536
01:54:22,165 --> 01:54:24,667
with a chewed up back,
ain't worth $300?

1537
01:54:24,834 --> 01:54:29,130
They doin' it 'cause that nigger
Django's in love with Hildi.

1538
01:54:29,297 --> 01:54:31,132
She probably his wife.

1539
01:54:31,299 --> 01:54:34,093
Now, why that German gives a fuck
who that uppity son of a bitch

1540
01:54:34,260 --> 01:54:37,347
is in love with,
I'm sure I don't know.

1541
01:54:39,933 --> 01:54:41,893
If she's who they want...

1542
01:54:42,477 --> 01:54:46,773
...why this whole snake oil pitch
about Mandingos, then?

1543
01:54:46,940 --> 01:54:50,443
You wouldn't pay no
never mind to no $300.

1544
01:54:50,610 --> 01:54:56,074
But that 12,000? That made you
real friendly, now, didn't it?

1545
01:54:58,785 --> 01:55:00,453
Yes, it did.

1546
01:55:03,790 --> 01:55:05,416
His wife, huh?

1547
01:55:09,295 --> 01:55:13,007
If it had been a snake,
it would have bit me.

1548
01:55:13,174 --> 01:55:14,592
[chuckles]

1549
01:55:16,302 --> 01:55:18,304
Those lying...

1550
01:55:19,138 --> 01:55:25,144
...goddamn time-wastin'
sons of bitches.

1551
01:55:27,355 --> 01:55:28,523
Sons of bitches!

1552
01:55:29,148 --> 01:55:33,945
...out of New Orleans, so I have quite
a bit of practice with theater types.

1553
01:55:35,196 --> 01:55:36,656
Oh, there you are.

1554
01:55:36,823 --> 01:55:39,617
I was beginning to think that you
and that old crow run off together.

1555
01:55:39,784 --> 01:55:41,244
[all chuckling]

1556
01:55:41,411 --> 01:55:43,580
That'd be a hell of a note, wouldn't it?

1557
01:55:43,746 --> 01:55:46,833
Lara Lee, I was just
looking out the big window.

1558
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:50,044
Billy Crash is out there
dealing with some shady slaver

1559
01:55:50,211 --> 01:55:51,296
trying to sell a passel of ponies.

1560
01:55:51,462 --> 01:55:55,341
Would you be a dear, go out there
and give them gals an eyeball? Hm?

1561
01:55:55,508 --> 01:55:57,760
- Of course, brother.
- Thank you, darling.

1562
01:56:11,024 --> 01:56:14,736
- Yeah. Business never sleeps.
- Hm-mm.

1563
01:56:16,779 --> 01:56:19,699
Apropos, before your exit,

1564
01:56:19,866 --> 01:56:23,870
we were discussing the possibility
of my purchasing Broomhilda.

1565
01:56:24,037 --> 01:56:26,956
Ah, yes. Yes, we were, doctor.

1566
01:56:27,123 --> 01:56:29,250
And we will again. In a moment.

1567
01:56:45,725 --> 01:56:47,769
Who's your little friend?

1568
01:56:50,146 --> 01:56:51,189
[clearing throat]

1569
01:56:52,732 --> 01:56:54,233
This is Ben.

1570
01:56:55,568 --> 01:57:00,573
He's a old Joe that
lived around here for a long time.

1571
01:57:00,740 --> 01:57:03,159
And I do mean a long damn time.

1572
01:57:04,243 --> 01:57:07,997
Old Ben here took care of my daddy...

1573
01:57:08,873 --> 01:57:10,917
...and my daddy's daddy.

1574
01:57:11,084 --> 01:57:13,670
Till he up and keeled over one day...

1575
01:57:16,506 --> 01:57:18,174
...Old Ben took care of me.

1576
01:57:20,760 --> 01:57:24,555
Growing up the son of a huge
plantation owner in Mississippi

1577
01:57:24,722 --> 01:57:30,603
puts a white man in contact
with a whole lotta black faces.

1578
01:57:32,230 --> 01:57:37,527
I spent my whole life here,
right here in Candyland...

1579
01:57:38,778 --> 01:57:42,573
...surrounded by black faces.

1580
01:57:44,617 --> 01:57:46,953
Now, seeing them every day,
day in, day out,

1581
01:57:47,120 --> 01:57:50,289
I only had one question:

1582
01:57:54,001 --> 01:57:56,462
- Why don't they kill us?
- [laughs]

1583
01:57:59,465 --> 01:58:04,637
Now, right out there on that porch,
three times a week for 50 years,

1584
01:58:04,804 --> 01:58:09,726
Old Ben here would
shave my daddy with a straight razor.

1585
01:58:09,892 --> 01:58:15,022
Now, if I was Old Ben, I woulda
cut my daddy's goddamn throat

1586
01:58:15,189 --> 01:58:18,609
and it wouldn't have taken me
no 50 years to do it, neither.

1587
01:58:21,154 --> 01:58:22,655
But he never did.

1588
01:58:24,532 --> 01:58:25,825
Why not?

1589
01:58:27,201 --> 01:58:31,998
You see, the science of phrenology

1590
01:58:32,165 --> 01:58:37,253
is crucial to understanding
the separation of our two species.

1591
01:58:39,088 --> 01:58:42,800
In the skull of the African here,

1592
01:58:42,967 --> 01:58:45,094
the area associated
with submissiveness

1593
01:58:45,261 --> 01:58:50,767
is larger than any human or any other
subhuman species on planet Earth.

1594
01:58:51,851 --> 01:58:53,519
[sawing]

1595
01:59:06,282 --> 01:59:08,242
If you examine...

1596
01:59:09,619 --> 01:59:11,788
...this piece of skull here...

1597
01:59:18,085 --> 01:59:21,672
...you will notice
three distinct dimples.

1598
01:59:25,259 --> 01:59:28,971
Here, here and here.

1599
01:59:29,138 --> 01:59:30,389
Now...

1600
01:59:30,556 --> 01:59:35,561
...if I was holding the skull
of an Isaac Newton or Galileo,

1601
01:59:35,728 --> 01:59:38,231
these three dimples would be
found in the area of the skull

1602
01:59:38,397 --> 01:59:41,734
most associated with... creativity.

1603
01:59:42,401 --> 01:59:44,237
But this is the skull of Old Ben.

1604
01:59:44,862 --> 01:59:46,989
And in the skull of Old Ben,

1605
01:59:47,156 --> 01:59:49,450
unburdened by genius,

1606
01:59:49,617 --> 01:59:53,788
these three dimples exist in the area
of the skull most associated with...

1607
01:59:54,914 --> 01:59:56,249
...servility.

1608
01:59:57,250 --> 01:59:59,001
Now, Bright Boy...

1609
01:59:59,919 --> 02:00:02,088
...I will admit you are pretty clever.

1610
02:00:04,549 --> 02:00:06,634
But if I took this hammer here...

1611
02:00:08,761 --> 02:00:11,097
...and I bashed in your skull with it...

1612
02:00:12,098 --> 02:00:17,436
...you would have the same
three dimples in the same place...

1613
02:00:18,688 --> 02:00:20,147
...as Old Ben.

1614
02:00:21,274 --> 02:00:24,861
Hey! Now lay your palms
flat on that tabletop!

1615
02:00:25,027 --> 02:00:27,989
If you lift those palms
off that turtle shell tabletop,

1616
02:00:28,155 --> 02:00:31,409
Mr. Pooch is gonna let loose
with both barrels of that sawed-off.

1617
02:00:32,493 --> 02:00:35,621
There have been a lot of lies said
around this dinner table here tonight,

1618
02:00:35,788 --> 02:00:38,124
but that you can believe!

1619
02:00:38,291 --> 02:00:41,085
Mr. Moguy, would you be
so kind as to collect the pistol

1620
02:00:41,252 --> 02:00:43,629
hanging off these boys' hips here?

1621
02:00:48,342 --> 02:00:50,761
- Thank you ever so much.
- Doctor.

1622
02:00:55,308 --> 02:00:56,684
Where were we?

1623
02:01:01,147 --> 02:01:02,565
Jackass.

1624
02:01:06,569 --> 02:01:08,070
Ah, yes.

1625
02:01:08,237 --> 02:01:10,990
I do believe you were
just getting ready to make me

1626
02:01:11,157 --> 02:01:13,618
a proposition to buy Broomhilda.

1627
02:01:13,784 --> 02:01:15,161
Am I right?

1628
02:01:19,165 --> 02:01:20,499
Right.

1629
02:01:22,919 --> 02:01:24,420
Bring out Hildi!

1630
02:01:27,173 --> 02:01:28,716
Get over there yonder.

1631
02:01:30,176 --> 02:01:32,428
- [screams]
- Sit your ass in that goddamn...

1632
02:01:32,595 --> 02:01:33,846
[Stephen] Lay your hand
flat on that tabletop.

1633
02:01:34,013 --> 02:01:35,556
[Calvin] Now shut your mouth!

1634
02:01:39,852 --> 02:01:42,438
Dr. Schultz, in Greenville,

1635
02:01:42,605 --> 02:01:45,358
you yourself said that
for the right nigger

1636
02:01:45,524 --> 02:01:49,862
you'd be willin' to pay what some
may consider is a ridiculous amount.

1637
02:01:50,029 --> 02:01:53,074
To which me myself said,
"What is your definition of ridiculous?"

1638
02:01:53,240 --> 02:01:57,203
To which you said, "$12,000."

1639
02:01:57,995 --> 02:01:59,747
- [yells]
- Now, considering y'all

1640
02:01:59,914 --> 02:02:01,874
have ridden a whole lot of miles,

1641
02:02:02,041 --> 02:02:06,003
went through a whole lot of trouble,
and done spread a whole lot of bull

1642
02:02:06,170 --> 02:02:08,589
to purchase this
lovely lady right here,

1643
02:02:08,756 --> 02:02:14,720
it would appear that Broomhilda is,
in fact... the right nigger.

1644
02:02:14,887 --> 02:02:18,641
And if y'all want to leave
Candyland with Broomhilda,

1645
02:02:18,808 --> 02:02:24,438
the price is $12,000.

1646
02:02:24,605 --> 02:02:28,401
And I take it you prefer the "take it
or leave it" style of negotiation?

1647
02:02:30,653 --> 02:02:32,196
Yes, I do, doctor.

1648
02:02:33,030 --> 02:02:36,033
You see,
under the laws of Chickasaw County,

1649
02:02:36,200 --> 02:02:39,745
Broomhilda here is my property.

1650
02:02:39,912 --> 02:02:45,042
And I can choose to do with
my property whatever I so desire!

1651
02:02:46,127 --> 02:02:48,421
And if y'all think my price...

1652
02:02:49,088 --> 02:02:51,799
...for this nigger here
is too steep...

1653
02:02:51,966 --> 02:02:55,428
- [grunts]
- ...what I'm gonna desire to do is...

1654
02:02:59,348 --> 02:03:02,476
...take this goddamn hammer here
and beat her ass to death with it!

1655
02:03:02,643 --> 02:03:04,770
- Right in front of both y'all!
- Easy, big fella.

1656
02:03:04,937 --> 02:03:09,442
Then we can examine the three dimples
inside Broomhilda's skull!

1657
02:03:09,608 --> 02:03:13,779
Now, what's it gonna be, doc?
Huh?

1658
02:03:13,946 --> 02:03:15,281
- [Hildi whimpering]
- What's it gonna be?

1659
02:03:15,448 --> 02:03:19,326
May I lift the hands off the tabletop
in order to remove my billfold?

1660
02:03:20,536 --> 02:03:21,871
Yes, you may.

1661
02:03:35,634 --> 02:03:36,844
That 12.

1662
02:03:40,890 --> 02:03:42,767
- Sold!
- [screaming]

1663
02:03:42,933 --> 02:03:45,478
To the man with the exceptional beard

1664
02:03:45,644 --> 02:03:48,981
and his unexceptional nigger.

1665
02:03:54,820 --> 02:03:57,114
- Mr. Moguy.
- Yes, Calvin?

1666
02:03:57,281 --> 02:04:00,951
Will you make these gentlemen
a receipt for $12,000, please?

1667
02:04:01,118 --> 02:04:02,870
$12,000.

1668
02:04:05,998 --> 02:04:08,167
It was a pleasure doing
business with y'all.

1669
02:04:09,043 --> 02:04:10,795
Now, gentlemen...

1670
02:04:12,004 --> 02:04:13,881
...if you care to
join me in the parlor...

1671
02:04:14,840 --> 02:04:17,301
...we will be serving white cake.

1672
02:04:18,177 --> 02:04:19,804
[Beethoven's "Fur Elise"
played on harp]

1673
02:05:17,111 --> 02:05:17,778
- [screaming]
- [dogs snarling]

1674
02:05:33,169 --> 02:05:34,628
[screaming]

1675
02:05:45,639 --> 02:05:46,974
Well done, Calvin.

1676
02:05:49,476 --> 02:05:52,354
Excuse me.
Excuse me, ma'am?

1677
02:05:53,814 --> 02:05:57,484
Could you please stop playing Beethoven?
Take your hands off the harp!

1678
02:06:01,739 --> 02:06:02,823
[Stephen] Doctor!

1679
02:06:02,990 --> 02:06:05,618
- Doctor, you can't go in there!
- Stephen, Stephen.

1680
02:06:05,784 --> 02:06:06,952
He ain't got no business
going in there.

1681
02:06:07,119 --> 02:06:08,454
Let it be.

1682
02:06:08,621 --> 02:06:10,539
He's just a little upset, that's all.

1683
02:06:10,706 --> 02:06:12,124
I'll handle this.

1684
02:06:37,983 --> 02:06:39,276
White cake?

1685
02:06:40,277 --> 02:06:42,529
I don't go in for sweets, thank you.

1686
02:06:43,572 --> 02:06:44,782
Hm.

1687
02:06:49,536 --> 02:06:50,537
[Calvin chuckles softly]

1688
02:06:52,498 --> 02:06:55,209
You brooding about me
getting the best of you, huh?

1689
02:06:55,918 --> 02:07:00,673
Actually, I was thinking of that
poor devil you fed to the dogs today.

1690
02:07:00,839 --> 02:07:02,675
D'Artagnan.

1691
02:07:03,467 --> 02:07:07,263
And I was wondering what
Dumas would make of all this.

1692
02:07:07,429 --> 02:07:08,889
Come again?

1693
02:07:11,976 --> 02:07:16,021
Alexandre Dumas.
He wrote The <i>Three</i> Musketeers.

1694
02:07:16,188 --> 02:07:17,856
Yes, of course, doctor.

1695
02:07:18,023 --> 02:07:19,566
I figured you must be an admirer.

1696
02:07:19,733 --> 02:07:24,154
You named your slave
after his novel's lead character.

1697
02:07:24,321 --> 02:07:28,033
Now, if Alexandre Dumas
had been there today,

1698
02:07:28,200 --> 02:07:30,160
I wonder what
he would have made of it.

1699
02:07:32,204 --> 02:07:34,039
You doubt he'd approve, huh?

1700
02:07:36,250 --> 02:07:41,422
Yes. His approval would be
a dubious proposition at best.

1701
02:07:43,716 --> 02:07:45,509
Soft-hearted Frenchie.

1702
02:07:47,386 --> 02:07:49,596
Alexandre Dumas is black.

1703
02:07:53,434 --> 02:07:56,228
- Are these Broomhilda's papers?
- Yes, they are.

1704
02:07:56,395 --> 02:07:58,063
- May I?
- Of course.

1705
02:07:58,230 --> 02:07:59,606
Thank you.

1706
02:08:01,734 --> 02:08:04,695
That is her bill of sale,
her ownership history,

1707
02:08:04,862 --> 02:08:07,031
and, of course,
her freedom papers, doctor.

1708
02:08:07,197 --> 02:08:09,408
Would you have ink and pen for me?

1709
02:08:10,659 --> 02:08:13,579
- Right over there on that little table.
- Thank you.

1710
02:08:34,892 --> 02:08:36,101
Thank you.

1711
02:08:39,688 --> 02:08:41,982
Broomhilda Von Shaft...

1712
02:08:44,234 --> 02:08:46,612
...consider yourself a free woman.

1713
02:08:58,540 --> 02:09:00,501
Mr. Candie...

1714
02:09:02,461 --> 02:09:06,256
...normally,
I would say auf Wiedersehen.

1715
02:09:06,423 --> 02:09:10,886
But since what auf Wiedersehen actually
means is "till I see you again"

1716
02:09:11,053 --> 02:09:13,389
and since I never
wish to see you again,

1717
02:09:13,555 --> 02:09:18,227
to you, sir... I say, "goodbye."

1718
02:09:22,106 --> 02:09:23,399
Let's go.

1719
02:09:24,358 --> 02:09:25,901
Come on.

1720
02:09:27,611 --> 02:09:29,696
One more moment, doctor!

1721
02:09:31,573 --> 02:09:32,616
What?

1722
02:09:37,329 --> 02:09:39,456
It's a custom here in the South...

1723
02:09:39,957 --> 02:09:45,337
...once a business deal is concluded
that the two parties shake hands.

1724
02:09:46,171 --> 02:09:48,215
It implies good faith.

1725
02:09:48,382 --> 02:09:51,427
- I'm not from the South.
- But you are...

1726
02:09:51,593 --> 02:09:53,887
...in my house, doctor.

1727
02:09:54,763 --> 02:09:57,683
- So I'm afraid I must insist.
- Insist?

1728
02:09:57,850 --> 02:09:59,852
On what?
That I shake your hand?

1729
02:10:00,018 --> 02:10:03,313
Oh, then I'm afraid
I must insist in the opposite direction.

1730
02:10:03,939 --> 02:10:06,942
- You know what I think you are?
- What you think I am?

1731
02:10:07,109 --> 02:10:08,902
No, I don't.

1732
02:10:10,571 --> 02:10:15,784
- I think you are a bad loser.
- And I think you're an abysmal winner.

1733
02:10:15,951 --> 02:10:20,914
Nevertheless, here in Chickasaw
County, a deal ain't done

1734
02:10:21,081 --> 02:10:23,709
until the two parties
have shook hands.

1735
02:10:24,585 --> 02:10:27,421
Even after all that paper signin',
don't mean shit...

1736
02:10:28,380 --> 02:10:31,884
...you don't shake my hand.

1737
02:10:32,843 --> 02:10:38,515
If I don't shake your hand,
you're gonna throw away $12,000?

1738
02:10:38,682 --> 02:10:40,434
I don't think so.

1739
02:10:41,435 --> 02:10:42,603
Mr. Pooch?

1740
02:10:44,438 --> 02:10:49,151
If she tries to leave here before this
nigger-loving German shakes my hand,

1741
02:10:49,318 --> 02:10:51,069
you cut her ass down.

1742
02:10:53,989 --> 02:10:55,324
[cocking shotgun]

1743
02:11:13,091 --> 02:11:16,428
You really want me to shake your hand?

1744
02:11:18,096 --> 02:11:19,681
I insist.

1745
02:11:20,766 --> 02:11:23,435
If you insist.

1746
02:11:25,771 --> 02:11:26,980
[metal springing noise]

1747
02:11:40,035 --> 02:11:43,038
No! Calvin!

1748
02:11:44,122 --> 02:11:45,707
Calvin!

1749
02:11:45,874 --> 02:11:48,210
[slow heartbeat rhythm]

1750
02:11:52,047 --> 02:11:54,550
I'm sorry. I couldn't resist.

1751
02:11:57,386 --> 02:11:59,137
[sobbing]

1752
02:12:06,812 --> 02:12:08,981
Ni99er's gone crazy! Help!

1753
02:12:09,147 --> 02:12:10,941
- [screaming]
- Help, he's killing everyone!

1758
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:29,126
Holy...!

1759
02:12:29,293 --> 02:12:31,503
Shit! Son of a bitch!

1760
02:12:32,254 --> 02:12:34,256
[overlapping gunfire]

1761
02:12:35,674 --> 02:12:36,883
[man] Damn it! Fuckin'...!

1762
02:12:37,050 --> 02:12:39,386
- Get the...!
- [screaming continues]

1763
02:12:41,388 --> 02:12:42,848
[man] Damn it, son of a bitch!

1764
02:12:43,015 --> 02:12:44,558
What...? Fucking...

1765
02:12:44,725 --> 02:12:46,351
Goddamn it!

1766
02:12:47,686 --> 02:12:49,980
- What the fuck is going on?
- [screams]

1767
02:12:50,147 --> 02:12:52,107
You shot me!

1768
02:12:52,274 --> 02:12:55,360
- You stupid son of a bitch!
- [man] Sorry, Jessie!

1769
02:12:55,527 --> 02:12:59,656
Who the fuck gave a nigger
a goddamn gun?

Nigger! Gonna kill...!

[man continues screaming]
Motherfucker!

02:13:40,405 --> 02:13:42,240
[slow-motion gunshot]

1778

[rap song playing]

1779
02:13:49,081 --> 02:13:50,248
Shit!

[screaming]

1781
02:14:47,222 --> 02:14:48,306
Shit.

[overlapping gunshots]

Hold your fire!

02:15:08,744 --> 02:15:10,620
Stop shootin', goddamn it!

Django!

1789
02:15:20,922 --> 02:15:22,174
What?

1790
02:15:25,385 --> 02:15:27,012
We got your woman!

1791
02:15:28,430 --> 02:15:30,932
Billy Crash here got his pistol
upside her head.

1792
02:15:31,099 --> 02:15:33,685
- [gasping]
- You don't stop all that carrying on,

1793
02:15:33,852 --> 02:15:36,897
- he gonna blow her goddamn brains out.
- [gasping]

1794
02:15:37,063 --> 02:15:41,026
And that ain't no threat, horse boy.
That there is a promise.

1795
02:15:42,652 --> 02:15:43,862
Or...

1796
02:15:44,029 --> 02:15:47,032
...you can give up,
throw your gun out...

1797
02:15:48,158 --> 02:15:50,327
- ...we won't kill Hildi.
- Horseshit!

1798
02:15:50,494 --> 02:15:54,206
Honest lnjun, Django.
I swear 'fore God.

1799
02:15:55,290 --> 02:15:59,920
You give up,
ain't no harm gonna come to her.

1800
02:16:01,379 --> 02:16:03,799
And I'm supposed to believe
your black ass?

1801
02:16:03,965 --> 02:16:06,676
Personally, I don't give a good goddamn
what you believe or don't believe!

1802
02:16:06,843 --> 02:16:09,888
I believe if you don't
give up in the next ten seconds,

1803
02:16:10,055 --> 02:16:13,934
we gonna blow this bitch's brains out!
Believe that!

1804
02:16:16,186 --> 02:16:19,940
Don't do it. [sniffling]
You give me up.

1805
02:16:20,106 --> 02:16:21,942
- [Stephen] Six!
- Just let me go.

1806
02:16:22,108 --> 02:16:23,652
- Seven!
- They got too much.

1807
02:16:23,819 --> 02:16:25,403
- [Hildi] Django.
- [Stephen] Eight!

1808
02:16:25,570 --> 02:16:28,073
- I love you.
- Nine!

1809
02:16:28,240 --> 02:16:30,325
- [Django] Hold it!
- No.

1810
02:16:32,327 --> 02:16:33,411
<i>L</i> give UP-

1811
02:16:34,621 --> 02:16:37,374
I can't hear you, nigger.

1812
02:16:37,541 --> 02:16:40,043
I said I give up!

1813
02:16:50,345 --> 02:16:53,890
[up-tempo song plays]

1814
02:17:03,149 --> 02:17:05,694

Cock-a-doodle-do, nigger.

1819
02:18:47,462 --> 02:18:49,589
So y'all bounty hunters, huh?

1820
02:18:50,548 --> 02:18:53,301
I knew there was something
fishy about y'all.

1821
02:18:54,302 --> 02:18:56,513
We found your wanted posters...

1822
02:18:57,097 --> 02:18:59,307
...and book of figures
in your saddlebags.

1823
02:19:00,725 --> 02:19:02,352
I got to say...

1824
02:19:03,061 --> 02:19:06,356
...I ain't never heard of
no black bounty hunter before.

1825
02:19:06,523 --> 02:19:09,567
Black boy paid to kill white men?
How'd you like that line of work?

1826
02:19:10,610 --> 02:19:13,238
Probably pretty good while it lasted,
huh?

1827
02:19:15,281 --> 02:19:16,741
[sizzling]

1828
02:19:19,411 --> 02:19:21,329

[grunting]

1830
02:19:22,706 --> 02:19:24,541
Time to say good night
to them nuts, blackie.

- [yelling]
- On three. One...

1832
02:19:27,544 --> 02:19:30,422
- [screaming]
- I got you. Two...

1833
02:19:30,588 --> 02:19:33,800
- [screaming]
- Calm down, now, here it comes.

" [Stephen] Captain?

Miss Lara want to see you.

1836
02:19:39,305 --> 02:19:43,226
Something to do
with the Old Man's funeral.

1837
02:19:43,393 --> 02:19:47,188
Oh, and she changed her mind
'bout snipping Django.

1838
02:19:47,981 --> 02:19:50,817
She gonna give him
to the LeQuint Dickey people.

[Django moaning]

1840
02:19:52,652 --> 02:19:54,779
Well, she didn't
waste a minute telling me.

1841
02:20:02,037 --> 02:20:03,830
How disappointing.

1842
02:20:10,336 --> 02:20:12,130

[Stephen] You leavin'.

1845

This here what you take with you.

1846
02:20:36,196 --> 02:20:39,657
Your black ass has been all them
motherfuckers at The Big House

for the last few hours.

1848
02:20:43,411 --> 02:20:47,123
Seem like white folk ain't never
had a bright idea in they life

1849
02:20:47,290 --> 02:20:50,001
was coming up with all
kinds of ways to kill your ass.

1850
02:20:50,168 --> 02:20:55,465
Now, mind you, most of them ideas had
to do with fuckin' with your fun parts.

1851
02:20:55,632 --> 02:21:01,179
Now, that may seem like a good idea,
but truth is...

1852
02:21:02,764 --> 02:21:05,016
...when you snip a nigger's nuts,

1853
02:21:05,183 --> 02:21:09,395
most of them bleed out in,
oh, about, hm... seven minutes.

1854
02:21:09,562 --> 02:21:11,147
Most of 'em.

1855
02:21:11,356 --> 02:21:14,526
[chuckles]
Well, more than most.

1856
02:21:15,276 --> 02:21:21,116
Then I says: "Shitfire.

1857
02:21:21,282 --> 02:21:25,286
The niggers we sell to LeQuint Dickey
got it worse than that."

1858
02:21:26,329 --> 02:21:29,040
And they still sayin',
"Let's whip him to death."

1859
02:21:29,207 --> 02:21:32,502
Or "Throw him to the Mandingos."
"Feed him to Stonesipher's dogs."

1860
02:21:32,669 --> 02:21:35,880
And I said,
"What's so special about that?

1861
02:21:36,047 --> 02:21:38,174
We do that shit all the time.

1862
02:21:38,341 --> 02:21:44,222
Hell's bells, the niggers we sell to
LeQuint Dickey got it worse than that."

1863
02:21:45,348 --> 02:21:48,059
Lo and behold,

1864
02:21:48,226 --> 02:21:53,064
out of nowhere, Miss Lara
come up with the bright idea

1865
02:21:53,231 --> 02:21:56,693
of giving your ass to the
LeQuint Dickey Mining Company.

1866
02:21:59,070 --> 02:22:04,200
And as a slave of the
LeQuint Dickey Mining Company,

1867
02:22:04,367 --> 02:22:07,912
henceforth, till the day you die,

1868
02:22:08,079 --> 02:22:11,207
all day, every day,

1869
02:22:11,374 --> 02:22:14,210
you will be swinging
a sledgehammer,

1870
02:22:14,377 --> 02:22:19,007
turning big rocks into little rocks.

1871
02:22:19,174 --> 02:22:23,761
Now, when you get there,
they gonna take away your name,

1872
02:22:23,928 --> 02:22:26,848
give you a number
and a sledgehammer,

1873
02:22:27,015 --> 02:22:29,434
and say, "Get to work!"

1874
02:22:29,601 --> 02:22:32,020
One word of sass,
they cuts out your tongue.

1875
02:22:32,187 --> 02:22:34,522
And they good at it too.
You won't bleed out.

1876
02:22:34,689 --> 02:22:38,359
Oh, they does that real good.

1877
02:22:38,526 --> 02:22:40,111
They gonna work ya.

1878
02:22:40,278 --> 02:22:45,283
All day, every day,
till your back give out.

1879
02:22:45,450 --> 02:22:48,036
Then they're gonna hit you
in the head with a hammer,

1880
02:22:48,203 --> 02:22:50,622
throw your ass down the nigger hole.

1881
02:22:50,788 --> 02:22:56,169
And that will be the story of you,
Django.

1882
02:22:57,712 --> 02:22:59,631
[slow-tempo song plays]

1883
02:23:35,208 --> 02:23:37,669
[man, Australian accent] And what's
the golden rule, Frankie, eh?

1884
02:23:37,835 --> 02:23:39,963
You don't root abos.

1885
02:23:44,717 --> 02:23:46,177
Hey, white boy.

1886
02:23:47,720 --> 02:23:49,889
I said, hey, white boy.

1887
02:23:50,056 --> 02:23:53,142
Shut up, black. You ain't got
nothing to say I want to hear.

1888
02:23:53,309 --> 02:23:55,603
How'd you like to make $11,000?

1889
02:23:55,770 --> 02:23:56,938
Do what, now?

1890
02:23:57,105 --> 02:24:02,902
I said how'd you like to make $11,000?
11,500, actually.

1891
02:24:03,069 --> 02:24:05,029
What the fuck are you talking about?

1892
02:24:05,196 --> 02:24:09,867
Back there at that plantation,
Candyland, there was an $11,500 fortune,

1893
02:24:10,034 --> 02:24:12,870
just sittin' there.
And y'all rode right past it.

1894
02:24:13,830 --> 02:24:15,540
You be damned, blackie,
we're not bandits.

1895
02:24:15,707 --> 02:24:19,919
I ain't saying that. Nice thing
about this fortune is it ain't illegal.

1896
02:24:20,086 --> 02:24:21,504
You can't steal it.

1897
02:24:21,671 --> 02:24:23,339
You got to earn it, white boy.

1898
02:24:24,299 --> 02:24:26,301
You got something to say, mate,
you say it.

1899
02:24:26,467 --> 02:24:29,679
The $11,500 fortune waitin'
for you back at Candyland

1900
02:24:29,846 --> 02:24:31,973
is in the form of a
"Wanted Dead or Alive" bounty

1901
02:24:32,140 --> 02:24:34,475
on Smitty Bacall and the Bacall Gang.

1902
02:24:34,642 --> 02:24:36,102
Who the fuck is Smitty Bacall?

1903
02:24:36,269 --> 02:24:39,564
Smitty Bacall is the leader of this
murderous gang of stagecoach robbers,

1904
02:24:39,731 --> 02:24:41,316
the Bacall Gang.

1905
02:24:41,482 --> 02:24:44,736
There's a $7,000
"Wanted Dead or Alive" bounty on him,

1906
02:24:44,902 --> 02:24:48,239
$1,500 for each
of his three accomplices:

1907
02:24:48,406 --> 02:24:51,659
Dandy Michaels, Gerald Nash,

1908
02:24:51,826 --> 02:24:54,537
and Crazy Craig Koons.

1909
02:24:54,704 --> 02:24:56,122
Now, all four of them gentlemen,

1910
02:24:56,289 --> 02:24:58,416
they back there at Candyland
laughing their ass off.

1911
02:24:58,583 --> 02:25:02,253
You know why?
'Cause they just got away with murder.

1912
02:25:02,420 --> 02:25:03,963
But it ain't got to be that way.

1913
02:25:04,130 --> 02:25:07,425
You and your mates, y'all can ride back
there and y'all can go get that money.

1914
02:25:07,592 --> 02:25:08,676
What'd these jokers do again?

1915
02:25:08,843 --> 02:25:12,347
These sons of bitches,
they killed innocent people.

1916
02:25:12,513 --> 02:25:15,767
Stagecoach robbery.
Innocent white people.

1917
02:25:16,851 --> 02:25:19,854
I got the handbill right here
in my pocket, if you let me get it.

1918
02:25:20,021 --> 02:25:21,189
Get it out.

1919
02:25:22,940 --> 02:25:28,196
[man 1] "Wanted. Dead or alive. Smitty
Bacall and the Smitty Bacall Gang."

1920
02:25:28,363 --> 02:25:29,697
- [man 2] But you're a slave.
- [man 1] "For murder..."

1921
02:25:29,864 --> 02:25:32,367
- [Django] I ain't no goddamn slave.
- [man 1] "...and stagecoach robbery."

1922
02:25:32,533 --> 02:25:33,785
Do I sound like a fuckin' slave?

1923
02:25:34,118 --> 02:25:35,578
- [man 1] "$7,000 for Smitty Bacall."
- Hm?

1924
02:25:35,745 --> 02:25:38,539
- [man 2] That's a shitload.
- I'm a bounty hunter.

1925
02:25:39,957 --> 02:25:42,543
Yesterday, as a free man,

1926
02:25:42,710 --> 02:25:47,256
I rode into Candyland on a horse
with my German white partner,

1927
02:25:47,423 --> 02:25:48,966
Dr. King Schultz.

1928
02:25:49,133 --> 02:25:53,888
We tracked the Bacall Gang all the way
from Texas to Chickasaw County.

1929
02:25:54,055 --> 02:25:56,974
We finally found their ass
layin' low in Candyland.

1930
02:25:57,141 --> 02:26:00,645
We went in there to get 'em,
things went sour,

1931
02:26:00,812 --> 02:26:04,148
my partner got killed,
Calvin Candie got shot,

1932
02:26:04,315 --> 02:26:08,486
then everybody there
decided to blame me, so here I am.

1933
02:26:10,488 --> 02:26:12,407
But y'all know I ain't on that manifest.

1934
02:26:12,573 --> 02:26:15,368
And all y'all know
I ain't supposed to be on this trip.

1935
02:26:15,535 --> 02:26:18,871
But them four men is still back there,
they're still wanted,

1936
02:26:19,038 --> 02:26:22,333
and that 11,500 is up for grabs,
and the last thing they'd expect

1937
02:26:22,500 --> 02:26:24,752
is y'all ridin' back in there
and gettin' it.

1938
02:26:24,919 --> 02:26:26,671
[man 1] What's the deal?

1939
02:26:26,838 --> 02:26:30,299
You tell us who they are
and we turn you loose?

1940
02:26:30,466 --> 02:26:33,344
No,no,no,no.
I ain't gonna tell you who they are.

1941
02:26:33,511 --> 02:26:37,014
But, you give me a pistol,
one of them horses,

1942
02:26:37,181 --> 02:26:41,686
and $500 of that 11,500,
and I'll point 'em out to you.

1943
02:26:41,853 --> 02:26:43,729
This is a real handbill.

1944
02:26:43,896 --> 02:26:44,939
Now just 'cause it's a real handbill

1945
02:26:45,106 --> 02:26:47,191
doesn't mean that other
bunch of malarkey is.

1946
02:26:47,358 --> 02:26:53,281
Now why would a slave have a "Wanted
Dead or Alive" handbill in his pocket?

1947
02:26:57,952 --> 02:27:00,746
Did that black ride
into Candyland yesterday?

1948
02:27:07,086 --> 02:27:11,048
All right, I'm gonna ask you again.

1949
02:27:12,258 --> 02:27:14,886
I want you to remember,
I don't like liars.

1950
02:27:15,595 --> 02:27:17,430
Is he a Candyland slave,

1951
02:27:17,597 --> 02:27:21,392
or did he ride in with a white man
on a horse yesterday?

1952
02:27:21,559 --> 02:27:25,229
Yeah. They walked us
from the Greenville auction,

1953
02:27:25,396 --> 02:27:27,940
and he rode in on a horse
with a white man.

1954
02:27:28,608 --> 02:27:32,778
Now this white man,
was the black his slave?

1955
02:27:32,945 --> 02:27:34,447
He weren't no slave.

1956
02:27:34,614 --> 02:27:38,451
- You fuckin' sure about that?
- Damn sure.

1957
02:27:42,413 --> 02:27:45,958
- What happened over in Candyland?
- Bunch-a shootin'.

1958
02:27:46,125 --> 02:27:47,919
Massa got shot.

1959
02:27:48,085 --> 02:27:50,213
- Who shot him?
- The German.

1960
02:27:50,379 --> 02:27:51,422
Why'd he do that?

1961
02:27:52,089 --> 02:27:55,551
Nigger and the German was actin'
like they were slavers but they wasn't.

1962
02:27:55,718 --> 02:27:58,804
- Well, what were they?
- Bounty hunters.

1963
02:27:59,889 --> 02:28:03,226
Fuck me, Roy.
I mean, this could be big, mate.

1964
02:28:04,268 --> 02:28:07,480
Well, smoke, you got a deal.

1965
02:28:08,981 --> 02:28:11,817
- I got one more condition.
- What's that?

1966
02:28:11,984 --> 02:28:15,780
When we get there, when time come...

1967
02:28:17,156 --> 02:28:20,117
- ...you let me help you kill 'em.
- Hey... [laughs]

1968
02:28:20,284 --> 02:28:21,953
...you're a funny bugger.

1969
02:28:22,119 --> 02:28:24,497
- Cut him loose.
- Yeah, yeah.

1970
02:28:24,664 --> 02:28:26,457
You got yourself a deal, blackie.

1971
02:28:26,624 --> 02:28:28,793
[mimics accent]
You got yourself a deal, mate.

1972
02:28:28,960 --> 02:28:30,670
Hey! [laughs]

1973
02:28:30,836 --> 02:28:32,171
You're all right for a black fella.

1974
02:28:32,338 --> 02:28:33,589
Oh, yeah.

1975
02:28:38,803 --> 02:28:40,471
There we go.
There you go, mate.

1976
02:28:40,638 --> 02:28:42,014
Yeah.

1977
02:28:42,181 --> 02:28:44,850
We're gonna give you
that packhorse over there.

1978
02:28:45,017 --> 02:28:46,978
What them saddlebags got in 'em?

1979
02:28:47,144 --> 02:28:49,021
- Dynamite.
- No. I ain't ridin' no horse

1980
02:28:49,188 --> 02:28:51,107
with no goddamn dynamite on its back.

1981
02:28:51,274 --> 02:28:53,150
I can understand that.

1982
02:28:53,317 --> 02:28:56,153
Frankie, why don't you
take them sticks off that horse

1983
02:28:56,320 --> 02:28:58,155
and stick 'em in the nigger cage.

1984
02:28:59,782 --> 02:29:01,951
A little dynamite for you
black fellas to play with.

1985
02:29:02,118 --> 02:29:04,161
[laughs]

1986
02:29:13,504 --> 02:29:16,173
Now, Floyd, you got that
rifle up on the wagon, don't ya?

1987
02:29:16,340 --> 02:29:17,341
Yeah, right.

1988
02:29:17,508 --> 02:29:20,052
Why don't you give him
your gun and gun belt?

1989
02:29:20,219 --> 02:29:21,512
Righto.

1990
02:29:21,679 --> 02:29:24,807
Now, don't drop the fuckin' thing,
all right?

1991
02:29:24,974 --> 02:29:27,893
I've just had the sights fixed
and they're perfect.

1992
02:29:28,060 --> 02:29:29,186
Oh, that's good to know.

Throw me up that dynamite.

- [man] Jake!
- Yeah?

1999

Get out there and see what's

The D is silent, hillbilly.

Oh, no!

2041

Now, all you black folks,

2042
02:37:50,854 --> 02:37:54,233
I suggest you get away
from all these white folks.

2043
02:37:55,192 --> 02:37:56,860
Not you, Stephen.

2044
02:37:57,402 --> 02:37:59,571
You right where you belong.

2045
02:38:01,949 --> 02:38:06,370
Cora, before you go,
will you tell Miss Lara goodbye?

2046
02:38:06,537 --> 02:38:11,375

Stephen, how you like my new duds?

2052
02:38:44,158 --> 02:38:46,743
You know, before now I didn't know
that burgundy was my color.

2053
02:38:58,380 --> 02:39:00,299
I count six shots, nigger.

2054
02:39:01,758 --> 02:39:03,594
I count two guns, nigger.

2055
02:39:07,598 --> 02:39:09,433
You said in 76 years on this plantation,

Nine thousand?

2064
02:39:28,619 --> 02:39:31,413
Nine thousand, nine hundred
and ninety-nine?

2065
02:39:31,580 --> 02:39:33,957
Every single word that came
out of Calvin Candie's mouth

2066
02:39:34,124 --> 02:39:35,459
was nothin' but horseshit.

2067
02:39:35,626 --> 02:39:39,463
But he was right about one thing:
I am that one nigger in 10,000.

[screaming, sobbing]

2069

You ain't gonna get away with this,
Django!

You gonna be on the

You can't destroy Candyland!

2082

We been here!
There's always gonna be a Candyland!

2083

[medium-tempo song plays]

2085
02:40:34,851 --> 02:40:38,397
[Stephen] Can't no nigger gunfighter

2086
02:40:38,563 --> 02:40:41,191
They gonna find your black ass!

2087
02:40:41,358 --> 02:40:43,944
[Stephen laughs hysterically]

2088

Hey, Little Trouble Maker.

2092
02:41:27,863 --> 02:41:29,781
Hey, Big Trouble Maker.

2093
02:41:57,100 --> 02:42:01,730
You know what they are going to call
you? "The fastest gun in the South."

2094
02:42:09,363 --> 02:42:10,947
Let's get outta here.

2095
02:42:28,423 --> 02:42:30,967

[rap song playing]

2097
02:45:39,823 --> 02:45:41,366
Who was that nigger?
